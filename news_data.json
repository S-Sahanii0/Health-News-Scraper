            "Content": "Health experts across the globe are raising concerns about the newly discovered COVID-19 variant, Omicron, which was first identified in South Africa. The country's minister of health announced last week that the variant had already spread in different areas of the country. \nThe next day, the World Health Organization designated Omicron a \"variant of concern.\" \nPresident Joe Biden echoed this statement at a news briefing today, but he stressed that the new variant is a \"cause for concern, not a cause for panic.\"\nCOVID-19 vaccine makers are looking into the vaccine's protection against the new variant.\n\"The mutations in the Omicron variant are concerning, and for several days, we have been moving as fast as possible to execute our strategy to address this variant,\" St\u00e9phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, said in a statement. \nPfizer says that data about its vaccine's protection against Omicron should be released in the coming weeks. \nA number of countries are making efforts to prevent the global spread of Omicron. The US is just one of a number of countries that have placed new travel restrictions on South Africa and its neighboring countries. \nSo what makes Omicron different from other COVID-19 variants? And how concerned should we be? Health experts help us break it down. \nWhat Do We Know So Far? \nThere is a lot that we don't know about Omicron, including whether it causes more severe illness than other variants, says Leana Wen, MD, MSc, an emergency doctor and public health professor at George Washington University in Washington, DC.\nBut we do know that it's a variant with an unusually high number of mutations, or changes in the virus' genetic material. \nEarly evidence also shows that the Omicron variant may spread easier than other COVID-19 variants, she says. \n\"That's very concerning because Delta, which is the dominant variant here in the US and around the world, is already extremely contagious. So, if this is even more contagious, it could displace the Delta variant,\" says Wen.\nIs the Omicron Variant in the US?\nAs of right now, no cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in the US. \nEither way, you should stay calm, says William Schaffner, MD, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\"Even if it were to be here in the United States, the dominant \u2014 the 99% that is causing disease in your community today \u2014 that strain is Delta,\" he says. \"And we know the vaccines work against Delta.\"\nWill COVID-19 Vaccines Work Against Omicron?\n\"We don't know whether the large number of mutations renders the vaccines less effective against this variant,\" says Wen. \"Although many scientists believe \u2014 especially with a booster shot \u2014 that it's not going to render the vaccines ineffective.\"",

            "Content": "The new Omicron coronavirus variant, which has been detected in several countries in recent days, will spread widely across the world and inevitably reach the U.S., Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday.\n\"Obviously, we're on high alert,\" he said on Good Morning America .\n\"It's inevitable that, sooner or later, it's going to spread widely because it has at least the molecular characteristics of being highly transmissible,\" he said. \"Even though there are a lot of things about it that we do not know but will be able to ascertain in the next week or two.\"\nDespite the unknowns, Fauci said, vaccinated people seem to be faring better against the new variant than unvaccinated people. Those who have received booster doses appear to be doing even better.\n\"I would strongly suggest you get boosted now and not wait for the next iteration of [the vaccine], which we may not even need,\" he said. \"The pharmaceutical companies are preparing to make a specific booster for [the Omicron variant], but we may not need that.\"\nAs of Monday morning, 12 countries had reported 165 cases of the Omicron variant to GISAID, a global database for the genomic sequencing of viruses. South Africa, which first detected the variant and reported it to the WHO, has found 114 cases, followed by 19 in Botswana, 12 in the Netherlands, and five in Australia. Four or fewer cases have also been reported in the U.K., Belgium, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, and Italy.\nOn Sunday, Canada became the first country in North America to detect the Omicron variant, with two cases confirmed in Ontario.\nOn Monday, Portugal confirmed 13 cases of the variant among a Lisbon-based soccer club, including one player who had recently traveled to southern Africa, according to ABC News.\nPresident Joe Biden will provide an update on the administration's response to the Omicron variant on Monday, according to The Hill. Biden met with Fauci and members of the White House COVID-19 Response Team on Sunday to discuss the new variant and the latest information from the WHO, which labeled Omicron a \"variant of concern.\"\nDuring the meeting, Fauci told Biden that it will take \"approximately 2 more weeks\" to learn more about the Omicron variant, The Hill reported, including details about how it spreads, how severe it can be, and how well it can evade vaccines.\nFauci emphasized that people should get vaccinated against COVID-19, noting that he believes the shots are \"likely to provide a degree of protection against severe cases of COVID.\" He also urged vaccinated people to get booster shots \"as soon as possible\" to \"provide the strongest available protection from COVID.\"\nA group of senior health officials in the Biden administration had a call with South African scientists on Sunday to review the latest information about the Omicron variant and determine next steps, according to The Washington Post.",

            "Content": "Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday classified a new COVID-19 variant from South Africa as a variant of concern, which means it could be more contagious, cause more severe disease, and reduce the efficacy of vaccines and treatments.\nWHO convened an independent group of experts on Friday to assess the new variant based on the rapid increase in COVID-19 infections in South Africa this week. Known scientifically as B.1.1.529, the variant was named Omicron.\n\"Omicron has some concerning properties. This variant has a large number of mutations, and some of these mutations have some worrying characteristics,\" Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, WHO's technical lead on the coronavirus pandemic, said in a video statement.\n\"Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other [variants of concern],\" WHO said in a statement. \"The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa.\"\nIn response, the White House announced new travel restrictions for flights from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. Foreign nationals from those countries will be prohibited from entering the United States.\n\"These new restrictions will take effect on November 29,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement. \"As we move forward, we will continue to be guided by what the science and my medical team advises.\"\nUS Monitoring for Variant\nThe United States hasn't detected any cases of the new variant yet, Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN. \n\"Right now, we're getting the material together with our South African colleagues to get to a situation where you could actually directly test it,\" Fauci said. \"So, right now you're talking about...a red flag that this might be an issue \u2014 but we don't know.\"\nScientists in South Africa began tracking the variant this week after a jump in COVID-19 cases and reported the variant to WHO on Wednesday. The first known confirmed infection was from a sample collected on November 9, WHO said.\nSeveral labs have found that one widely used test could be a reliable way to detect the new variant. WHO's virus evolution advisory group has started \"a number of studies\" to evaluate Omicron and will announce new findings as needed, Van Kerkhove said Friday.\nBased on the evidence so far, WHO has advised countries to enhance their surveillance and genomic sequencing efforts to better understand the variant. WHO also requested that countries submit genomic sequences to public databases, such as GISAID.\nOn Friday, 66 sequences of the B.1.1.529 variant had been reported to GISAID, including 58 in South Africa, six in Botswana, and two in Hong Kong.\nWHO has also asked countries to conduct field investigations and lab analyses about the severity of the variant, as well as immune responses, antibody neutralization, and effectiveness of public health and social measures.\n\"Individuals are reminded to take measures to reduce their risk of COVID-19, including proven public health and social measures such as wearing well-fitting masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, and getting vaccinated,\" WHO said.\nBiden called on other nations to increase vaccine donations to poorer nations.\n\"The news about this new variant should make clearer than ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations,\" Biden said. \"The United States has already donated more vaccines to other countries than every other country combined. It is time for other countries to match America's speed and generosity.\"\nIsrael imposed a travel ban covering most of Africa after discovering its first case in someone who had recently traveled from Malawi. A growing list of countries has halted or restricted flights, including Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Singapore, The New York Times reported.\n\"We are currently at the threshold of an emergency situation,\" Naftali Bennett, the prime minister of Israel, said in a statement.\n\"I ask everyone to be prepared and to fully join in the work around the clock,\" he said.\nFollow Medscape on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.",

            "Content": "The association of atopic dermatitis (AD) with short stature and increased body mass index (BMI) in early childhood may be transient, often resolving by mid-adolescence, according to a large cohort study published online November 17 in JAMA Dermatology.\n\"The potential for 'catch up' in height for children with atopic dermatitis observed in our study may be explained with resolution of atopic dermatitis or successful treatment,\" write senior author Aaron M. Drucker, MD, ScM, from the Division of Dermatology, University of Toronto, and Women's College Hospital in Toronto, Canada, and colleagues. They postulated that while the association between AD and shorter height is \"is likely multifactorial,\" it may be driven in part by sleep loss caused by AD, or corticosteroid treatment of AD, both of which can result in growth retardation and subsequent increased BMI.\nThe researchers used data from TARGet Kids!, a prospective, longitudinal cohort study designed to study multiple health conditions in children from general pediatric and family practices across Toronto. Their study included 10,611 children for whom there was data on height, weight, BMI, and standardized z scores, which account for age and sex differences in anthropometric characteristics. Clinically relevant covariates that were collected included child age, sex, birth weight, history of asthma, family income, maternal and paternal ethnicity, and maternal height and BMI.\nThe mean age of the children in the study at cohort entry was 23 months and they were followed for a median of 28.5 months, during which time they had a median of two visits. At baseline, 947 (8.9%) children had parent-reported AD, with this number rising to 1834 (17.3%) during follow-up.\nAfter adjusting for covariates, AD was associated with lower mean z-height (P < .001), higher mean z-BMI (P = .008), but lower mean z-weight (P < .001) compared with children without AD. Using World Health Organization growth tables, the researchers estimated that \"children with atopic dermatitis were, on average, approximately 0.5 cm shorter at age 2 years and 0.6 cm shorter at age 5 years than children without atopic dermatitis\" after adjusting for covariates. They also estimated that children with AD were \"on average, approximately 0.2 more BMI units at age 2 years\" than children without AD. The associations between AD and height diminished by age 14 years, as did the association between AD and BMI by age 5\u00bd years.\n\"Given that we found children with atopic dermatitis to be somewhat less heavy, as measured by z-weight, than children without atopic dermatitis and that this association did not attenuate with age, it is possible that our findings for BMI, and perhaps those of previous studies, are explained mainly by differences in height,\" the authors write. \"This distinction has obvious clinical importance \u2014 rather than a focus on obesity and obesogenic behaviors being problematic in children with atopic dermatitis, research might be better directed at understanding the association between atopic dermatitis and initially shorter stature.\"\nAsked to comment on the study results, Jonathan Silverberg, MD, PhD, MPH, associate professor of dermatology, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, told Medscape Medical News he would have preferred using the wording \"in addition to focusing on obesity,\" rather than \"focus on obesity.\"\n\"We should not ignore diet and sedentary activity as important factors,\" he said, pointing to another recent study that found higher rates of eating disorders associated with AD.",

            "Content": "The American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) could lose its seat at the American Medical Association (AMA) \"table,\" unless the radiation oncology organization boosts its AMA membership.\nAccording to a blog post earlier this month, ASTRO was \"disheartened\" to learn it was in danger of losing representation at the AMA's House of Delegates.\nMembership in the House of Delegates requires that a certain percentage of each society's members also hold membership in the AMA. Unfortunately, ASTRO has not fulfilled that requirement and is currently in a 1-year probation period, after which \"ASTRO's voice will be silenced in the House of Delegates,\" the authors of the blog post write.\n\"My friends, it is absolutely critical that we continue to have ASTRO delegates at the table to advocate and testify at the AMA in support of radiation oncology interests,\" write authors Thomas Eichler MD, immediate past chair of ASTRO board of directors; Shane Hopkins MD, ASTRO delegate to AMA; Ankit Agarwal MD, MBA, ASTRO alternate delegate to AMA; and Shilpen Patel, MD, ASTRO delegate to AMA.\nThe authors acknowledged the skepticism some radiation oncologists have voiced on social media regarding AMA's representation of their specialty. However, skeptics may be unaware of the extent to which the AMA has advocated on behalf of radiation oncologists and for issues that benefit the specialty.\nIn August, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed changes to the Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model, which received intense pushback from ASTRO and other stakeholders. The final rule remained flawed despite \"relentless\" ASTRO advocacy and engagement with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to achieve fair and predictable reimbursement. The AMA made its opposition known, sending a detailed letter to CMS that reflected ASTRO's concerns.\nHere, the AMA put \"the weight of the whole of organized medicine behind\" ASTRO, the bloggers write.\nThis is not the only time the AMA has put its weight behind issues that affect radiation oncology. ASTRO worked with the AMA on a letter to the director of CMMI, detailing alternative payment model (APM) recommendations. The AMA was instrumental in combatting cuts to sustainable growth rate, until it was finally repealed in 2015. The AMA successfully fought insurance mergers, such as one between Anthem and Cigna, which would have cost physicians $500 million in annual payments. The association has also been a leading voice for reforming prior authorization burdens and will be representing physician interests on the upcoming Senate bill S.3018, the Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act.\n\"The AMA is one of the largest lobbying groups in the country, and the value of having them go to bat for us simply can't be replaced,\" the bloggers write. \"In short, the Association has fought against perennial challenges to our autonomy as physicians.\"\nIf ASTRO wishes to maintain AMA support and continue to vote on the many issues that affect radiation oncology and other specialties, more radiation oncologists need to join the AMA, the authors urge.\nFor more from Medscape Oncology, join us on Twitter and Facebook",

Now, more than a year later, Wisdom's company, Health in Her Hue, connects Black women and other women of color to culturally sensitive doctors, doulas, nurses and therapists nationally.\nAs more patients seek culturally competent care \u2014 the acknowledgment of a patient's heritage, beliefs and values during treatment \u2014 a new wave of Black tech founders like Wisdom want to help. In the same way Uber Eats and Grubhub revolutionized food delivery, Black tech health startups across the United States want to change how people exercise, how they eat and how they communicate with doctors.\nInspired by their own experiences, plus those of their parents and grandparents, Black entrepreneurs are launching startups that aim to close the cultural gap in health care with technology \u2014 and create profitable businesses at the same time.\n\"One of the most exciting growth opportunities across health innovation is to back underrepresented founders building health companies focusing on underserved markets,\" said Unity Stoakes, president and co-founder of StartUp Health, a company headquartered in San Francisco that has invested in a number of health companies led by people of color. He said those leaders have \"an essential and powerful understanding of how to solve some of the biggest challenges in health care.\"\nPlatforms created by Black founders for Black people and communities of color continue to blossom because those entrepreneurs often see problems and solutions others might miss. Without diverse voices, entire categories and products simply would not exist in critical areas like health care, business experts say.\n\"We're really speaking to a need,\" said Kevin Dedner, 45, founder of the mental health startup Hurdle. \"Mission alone is not enough. You have to solve a problem.\"\nDedner's company, headquartered in Washington, D.C., pairs patients with therapists who \"honor culture instead of ignoring it,\" he said. He started the company three years ago, but more people turned to Hurdle after the killing of George Floyd.\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, Erica Plybeah, 33, is focused on providing transportation. Her company, MedHaul, works with providers and patients to secure low-cost rides to get people to and from their medical appointments. Caregivers, patients or providers fill out a form on MedHaul's website, then Plybeah's team helps them schedule a ride.\nWhile MedHaul is for everyone, Plybeah knows people of color, anyone with a low income and residents of rural areas are more likely to face transportation hurdles. She founded the company in 2017 after years of watching her mother take care of her grandmother, who had lost two limbs to Type 2 diabetes. They lived in the Mississippi Delta, where transportation options were scarce.",

Instead\u2026 The love of my life flew in on a helicopter, dropped to a knee, and made me the luckiest girl on the planet.\"\nThe pair did not have a conventional courtship.

She immediately fell in love with the hospital, the team, and the work she was doing, she told Yahoo Life.\nAfter falling for Kennestone and the rest of her team, she fell in love with Young.\n\"As crazy as it sounds, we feel so lucky that we were able to fall in love during something as tragic as this pandemic,\" she said to Yahoo Life. \"It allowed us the opportunity to truly realize the extent we could depend on one another. I feel like the luckiest girl in the world that I get to literally save lives with my best friend.\"\nYoung's elaborate proposal took the efforts of nearly the entire hospital to get Dunlap to the helipad without spoiling the surprise. She thought she was responding to an emergency case but was actually walking into a life-changing question. In a complicated ruse involving other nurses, a pilot, and a fake patient, Young emerged from the helicopter, dropped to one knee, and popped the question. Even the photographer didn't arouse suspicion from Dunlap because he was already on site for ER Nurses Week. Shocked and holding back tears, she said yes.\n\"It took a village,\" Young said in an interview with CNN. \"It took about three other nurses, two or three people from my management team to come up with this whole scheme, to get her up on the chopper at the exact right moment for what I thought was the perfect idea for us.\"\nA video of the proposal has also gone viral on TikTok, amassing more than 2.6 million views.

            "Content": "With the holidays just around the corner (how did that happen?), it's a good time to remind yourself of the things you're grateful for.\nPerhaps you're grateful for spending chilly evenings under a warm blanket binge-watching your favorite shows or being able to safely gather with loved ones. If you're William Shatner, maybe you're grateful for that quick trip to space (because apparently, that's a thing now) and the poetic tweets it induced. Down here on earth, TikTok has surpassed 1 billion users, and while we're not grateful, necessarily, we are entertained.\nHere are the latest good, bad, and ugly TikToks that have been trending lately.\nThe Good: Doctor Demonstrates Correct EpiPen Use\nThis reaction TikTok from medical student Mutahir Farhan (aka @madmedicine) has over 252,000 likes and hundreds of comments. In it, Farhan watches a video of a young woman attempting to administer an EpiPen to her friend, with the caption \"How NOT to use an EpiPen\" over it (in bright red, of course).\nThe woman in the video is using the wrong end of the EpiPen against her friend's leg, so it isn't working. When she uses her thumb to press down and help, her thumb is actually pressed against the needle end and the EpiPen sticks her instead of her friend. Ouch!\nFarhan goes on to explain the anatomy of the EpiPen and shows his audience of 1.1 million followers where to inject it.\n\"You gotta remember that the orange tip is where the needle comes out. Otherwise, you're going to end up stabbing yourself with epinephrine, like that girl in the video,\" Farhan says. He goes on to instruct the important, but often overlooked, follow-up: \"After you stab someone with epinephrine, call 911 or go to the ER, so that we can make sure they're actually okay and good to go.\"\nThe Bad: Liquid Chlorophyll\nHere is another one of those tricky trends that are so widespread and popular that it's hard to find exactly where it originated from. A video from @lenamaiah has over 5 million views and 800,000 likes, which even by TikTok standards, is a lot. TikTok is rife with similar videos, which feature drops of liquid chlorophyll being added to water and smoothies.\nThe pretty emerald hue is mesmerizing and it's hard to resist trying it out when it's being peddled by seemingly every pretty, smooth-skinned pseudo-model on the platform. In this video, Lena says drinking a glass of water with a few drops of chlorophyll can reduce inflammation, get rid of eye bags, boost your vitamin levels, reduce free radical damage, detoxify your system, and file your taxes. Okay, I made that last one up, but it follows, doesn't it? This stuff sounds pretty good. Maybe too good.\nChlorophyll, if you skipped biology class (somehow, I doubt you did), is what makes plants green. Medscape has a detailed explanation of chlorophyll, but all you really need to know is that it's the secret to that cool thing plants do: photosynthesis, or turning sunlight into energy. Scientists have been trying to find uses for it in people since the 1940s. Unfortunately, studies never found much that it can do for us, aside from being kind of deodorizing. So, while it's been historically marketed as toothpaste and deodorant, the new TikTok claims of it being a cure-all or the next big skincare supplement are not widely substantiated by scientific studies. The only real evidence of it being effective is word of mouth from those who claim to like the way they look or feel since taking it, which isn't enough for doctors to recommend it.\nTikTok's resident dermatologist, Muneeb Shah, DO, stitched a TikTok from another user, with his captions explaining, \"[There's] no scientific evidence for liquid chlorophyll [helping] rosacea or acne.\"\nHis advice: \"Chlorophyll is great, but just eat more veggies.\"\nThe Ugly: Scalp Popping\nWarning: Don't watch this if you're easily freaked out by weird body sounds. It's like cracking your knuckles but way, way worse.\nThis TikTok from @asmr.barber has 1.7 million likes, and lots of people are trying it out for themselves. The viral video features the (disturbed) art of scalp popping, also known as hair cracking. It features what is assumed to be some sort of barber or professional (here's hoping) twisting a client's hair around his fingers and then yanking, creating an audible popping sound. Many are posting their own hair cracking attempts on the platform. It's unclear if this is supposed to feel good or just be grossly satisfying, though some users claim it helps with migraines.\nBut it turns out this might be more than kind of gross; it can be dangerous, too.\nAnthony Youn, MD, a board-certified plastic surgeon, comments on the trend with concern: \"What the hell is going on here?\" Not something you want to hear from a doctor. Youn explains that the popping sound comes from the galea aponeurotica, a fibrous sheet of connective tissue under your scalp, being pulled off the skull.\nIn a comment, Youn continued to warn people of replicating this trend: \"It can tear the inside of the scalp, which can bleed a ton on the inside. Think boxer or MMA fighter with scalp hematoma.\"\nLet's keep our scalps attached to our skulls, people. If I never have to hear that sound again, I'll be eternally grateful.\nFollow Medscape on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.",

During that time, there were virtually no vehicles on the roads or planes in the skies, and thus exhaust emissions and air pollution decreased. \nOn days when air pollution was lower, as measured by levels of inhalable fine particulate matter up to 2.5 micrometers wide (PM2.5 ), the number of STEMIs was also lower.  \nEach 10 \u00b5g/m3 reduction in PM2.5 levels was associated with 6% fewer STEMIs or 3.7 fewer STEMIs per 100 person-years, after adjusting for US census division, day of week, month, and year.\nThese findings by Sidney Aung, a fourth-year medical student at the University of California San Francisco, and colleagues were presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) 2021 Scientific Sessions. \n\"While more pollution is known to increase STEMI risk, this demonstration of the reciprocal relationship provides the most direct evidence that efforts to reduce ambient pollution can prevent the most severe forms of myocardial infarctions,\" they conclude.\nNatural Experiment  \nThe pandemic-related shutdown was a \"a unique opportunity\" to investigate how a short period of cleaner air might be associated with fewer severe heart attacks, senior author Gregory M. Marcus, MD, professor and associate chief of cardiology for research, University of California San Francisco, told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology in an email.\n\"And, indeed, as pollution fell, we found a concomitant reduction in the most serious forms of heart attack,\" he said.\nHowever, the researchers acknowledge that this was an observational study, so it cannot show cause and effect, and other unknown factors might explain the decrease in MI.\nNevertheless, \"these data suggest that a reduction in particulate matter with the shutdown may be at least partly responsible for the drop in heart attacks,\" said Marcus.\nThese findings can inform people \"about the possible immediate health impacts of pollution so that they can push for cleaner air initiatives,\" Aung told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology.\n\"We also hope this [work] inspires other investigators to corroborate these findings and conduct further research,\" he said.\n\"The links between air pollution levels and, in particular, particulate matter <2.5 microns and cardiovascular disease has been studied for over two decades,\" Sanjay Rajagopalan, MD, who co-authored an editorial about a study in China that linked air pollution with risk of fatal MIs, commented to theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology.",

Blood, MD, reported these study findings in a late-breaking session at the virtual American Heart Association (AHA) 2021 Scientific Sessions.\nResearchers delivered promising interim results in 5000 patients at last year's meeting, as previously reported and published.\nPatients were identified by electronic health record (EHR) screening or primary care clinician referral. They were given home blood pressure cuffs and received phone calls from non-licensed patient \"navigators\" who provided educational information and ordered lab tests; pharmacists initiated and titrated medicines \u2014 all without in-person patient visits.\nIn the current study, at 3 months, 40% of patients in the lipid management program and 44% of patients in the hypertension management program had attained maintenance levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure; 92% of these patients were at their target levels and the rest were close.  \n\"The program effectively improves hypertension and LDL-cholesterol in high-risk patients [and] reduces the need for in-person visits and physician time,\" Blood, a research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts concluded.\nThe findings also reaffirm difficulties in maintaining patients in a long-term program, even if it's free, he added. At the same time, this remote program was equally effective in patients who were not tech savvy or English speaking.\n\"The program has the potential to expand remote healthcare delivery, increase access to care, reduce health inequities, and improve healthcare quality,\" Blood said.\nHigh Satisfaction Among Patients, Physicians\nAmong the patients who reached maintenance levels, average blood pressure dropped from 145/84 mm Hg to 135/78 mm Hg, and average LDL-C decreased from 140 mg/dL to 70 mg/dL, from baseline to 3 months.\n\"Starting a high-intensity statin will lower LDL by 50% and up-titrating and adding blood pressure medications will lower blood pressure by this amount,\" so these findings were not surprising, senior author Benjamin M. Scirica, MD, MPH, explained to theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology in an email.\nThis study confirms that \"we have incredible therapies, mostly generic, that can substantially lower cardiovascular risk,\" said Scirica, director of quality initiatives at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Cardiovascular Division, and associate professor, Harvard School of Medicine, Boston.\n\"The challenge,\" he added, \"is the 'last mile' dilemma of all medical therapy: how do we identify, engage, motivate, and treat these patients more effectively with guideline-directed therapies?\"\nWith this program, \"we receive high patient satisfaction scores from patients and their primary care providers who are relieved to receive help in managing chronic diseases,\" he said.",

Staessen, MD, PhD, professor emeritus at the University of Leuven in Belgium.\nIn data from 30,827 patients at risk for HF enrolled in six observational studies, the hazard ratio (HR) for developing HF among those taking daily aspirin at baseline relative to those who were not was 1.26 (P \u2264 .001) over 5.3 years of follow-up. In the 22,690 patients without a prior history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the HF risk increase for exposure to daily aspirin was about the same (HR, 1.27; P = .001).\nThis study was launched because multiple conflicting studies have made the relationship between aspirin and HF risk unclear, according to the multinational team of authors, whose findings were published online in ESC Heart Failure.\nIn principle, HF is recognized as a prothrombotic condition for which an antithrombotic therapy such as aspirin would be expected to have a protective role, but the investigators pointed out that the evidence is mixed. In a population-based Danish study of 12,277 patients with new-onset HF, for example, there was no relationship seen between aspirin use and a reduction in the composite outcome of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke.\nAspirin Use Linked to HF Admissions\n\"Interestingly, this study reported that aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of readmissions for HF,\" wrote the authors of the newly published data. \"Uncertainty on aspirin use has been reflected in current guideline recommendations,\" they added.\nThe population studied was drawn from the HOMAGE database, which has collated data on 46,437 participants in 21 studies. After the exclusion of studies with patients who already had HF as well as studies without information on HF incidence over time, six studies with 30,827 participants provided the basis for this analysis.\nOne study, ASCOT, which was randomized and blinded, served as the derivation data set. The remaining five studies, FLEMENGHO, HEALTH ABC, HULL LIFE LAB, PREDICTOR, and PROSPER, served as the validation data set.\nIn addition to identifying participants as aspirin users or nonusers at baseline, all of the studies had detailed baseline data on a wide variety of patient characteristics and risk factors, such as body mass index, blood cholesterol levels, blood glucose concentrations, blood pressure, and creatinine.\nNo patient in any trial was on an antithrombotic therapy other than aspirin at baseline.",

Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said the state won't be \"defenseless\" if everyone wears masks indoors, gets vaccinated, gets tested, washes their hands and stays home when sick.\n\"Mark my words, we're going to see a surge in the next five days,\" Hochul said.\nAnd Dr. Dave Chokshi, the commissioner, said he is \"strongly recommending\" that all New Yorkers wear masks \"at all times when indoors and in a public setting like at your grocery or in a building lobby, offices and retail stores.\"\nThe guidance was in line with the recommendation issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in July that even vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where the virus is surging.\nMuch is still not known about the omicron variant, which was identified last week by researchers in South Africa, including whether it is more contagious than other coronavirus variants, or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.\nCases of the omicron variant have been found in countries including Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, but no cases have yet been detected in the United States.\nMayor Bill de Blasio said that while there have been no cases of the omicron variant reported in New York City, \"it is very likely there will be.\"\nChokshi, who joined de Blasio at a virtual news briefing, said the delta variant of the virus accounts for 98% of the coronavirus samples from New York City that are being sequenced now.\nHochul said she wasn't ready to announce any new sweeping COVID-19 protocols, like restrictions on visits at nursing homes.\nShe said she supports recent announcements by Erie County officials, who have warned that the county could start requiring vaccine mandates for indoor dining if rates keep surging.\nVaccination rates are increasing overall in New York, fueled in part by a mandate for health care workers to get vaccinated. New York City has also required vaccinations for city workers and for indoor dining, for example.\nBut vaccination rates are lower in western New York, the Finger Lakes and other rural communities north of New York City and its surrounding suburbs: as low as 40% in Allegany County, 47% in Wyoming County, and 49% in Yates and Seneca counties.",

The US is just one of a number of countries that have placed new travel restrictions on South Africa and its neighboring countries. \nSo what makes Omicron different from other COVID-19 variants?

Health experts help us break it down. \nWhat Do We Know So Far? \nThere is a lot that we don't know about Omicron, including whether it causes more severe illness than other variants, says Leana Wen, MD, MSc, an emergency doctor and public health professor at George Washington University in Washington, DC.\nBut we do know that it's a variant with an unusually high number of mutations, or changes in the virus' genetic material. \nEarly evidence also shows that the Omicron variant may spread easier than other COVID-19 variants, she says. \n\"That's very concerning because Delta, which is the dominant variant here in the US and around the world, is already extremely contagious. So, if this is even more contagious, it could displace the Delta variant,\" says Wen.\nIs the Omicron Variant in the US?\nAs of right now, no cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in the US. \nEither way, you should stay calm, says William Schaffner, MD, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\"Even if it were to be here in the United States, the dominant \u2014 the 99% that is causing disease in your community today \u2014 that strain is Delta,\" he says. \"And we know the vaccines work against Delta.\"\nWill COVID-19 Vaccines Work Against Omicron?\n\"We don't know whether the large number of mutations renders the vaccines less effective against this variant,\" says Wen. \"Although many scientists believe \u2014 especially with a booster shot \u2014 that it's not going to render the vaccines ineffective.\"",

However, scant evidence exists on when and how to best stop CRRT without the need to subsequently resume it, or a different form of dialysis, what's known as CRRT \"liberation.\"\nIn this new, retrospective, single-center, observational study, the Mayo investigators found a \"high\" failure rate and \"poor\" survival and kidney-related outcomes among patients with AKI who underwent CRRT liberation in ICU, the team writes in their recent report, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.\nHowever, they did identify variables that can be used to predict better outcomes when planning to attempt CRRT liberation, such as patients who were less sick on ICU admission, those with a shorter duration of CRRT, and patients with higher urinary output just before the liberation attempt.\nTheir new findings \"underscore the need for additional data and consensus guidelines to support the clinical practices of CRRT liberation,\" they add. \"There is no consensus on how to properly liberate patients from CRRT,\" a decision that clinicians currently make based on personal experience resulting in practice variability.\nAcute kidney injury is a common condition that patients admitted to ICU can develop and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.\nThe Importance of CRRT Liberation\n\"We used one of the largest CRRT datasets in North America to point out that liberation from dialysis is as important as the initiation of CRRT,\" explained Kianoush B. Kashani, MD, senior author of the report and professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic.\n\"The purpose of our research was to highlight the importance of the liberation phase, as its association with mortality is tremendous,\" he said in an interview.\nThe analysis showed that durable CRRT liberation was \"marginally\" associated with a relative 29% lower rate of major adverse kidney events during 90 days after the start of CRRT compared with patients who had to restart CRRT or another dialysis method following initial discontinuation, although the difference was not significant after adjustment for potential confounders (P = .08).\nThe researchers also found no significant difference in the cumulative probability of death during the 90-day follow-up between successfully liberated patients and those who had to restart dialysis.\nHowever, successful CRRT liberation did significantly and independently link with an 81% relative increase in the rate of kidney recovery after 90 days compared with those who had to resume dialysis.",

The gas also killed the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces.\n\"By combining cold plasma gas with acetyl donor molecules to improve its oxidation action, we found [the formulation] completely killed bacteria that are found in chronic wounds,\" lead author Endre J. Szili said in a press statement on the research, published in Applied Physics Letters.\n\"We investigated whether this same technology could be effective at killing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it appears that it is,\" said Szili, a senior research fellow and head of the Plasma Medicine Research Group at the Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Adelaide.\n\"To the best of knowledge our study is the first report on the use of plasma in combination with acetyl donor molecules,\" the authors note.\nCold plasma is a low-temperature, electrically generated, partially ionized glow-discharge that is tolerable to human tissue. Although the plasma gas can kill bacteria, the treatment can lose effectiveness against notoriously resistant biofilms.\nTo try to improve its efficacy in killing bacteria, Szili and colleagues combined the cold plasma with acetyl donor molecules and found the combination generated hydrogen peroxide and released peracetic acid, enhancing the ability to destroy resistant bacteria through a multipronged action.\n\"The combination of the cold plasma with acetyl donors produces additional oxidants that are less affected by the bacteria's antioxidant defense mechanisms,\" Szili explained to Medscape Medical News.\nThe formulation's synergistic effect \"can be used to target a broad spectrum of microbes and infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses,\" he added.\nGas Killed Bacteria in Foot Ulcers, COVID-19 Virus\nFor the study, the authors tested the strategy in lab experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responsible for infections in the blood, lungs, and other areas after surgery, and Staphylococcus aureus, linked to potentially life-threatening blood poisoning and pneumonia.\nThey found that, while the use of cold plasma alone was effective against P. aeruginosa, it had minimal effect on S. aureus. However, the combination treatment showed successful eradication of both types of bacteria.\n\"This is very significant for diabetic patients who have foot ulcers that are hard to heal,\" Szili said in the press statement.\nSimilar trends were observed when the virucidal activities of the formulation were tested against SARS-CoV-2.\nThe experiments showed that the plasma-activated blend effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load by 50%-84%, raising the possibility of its use in disinfecting surfaces such in hospitals or air-conditioning systems.",

Now, more than a year later, Wisdom's company, Health in Her Hue, connects Black women and other women of color to culturally sensitive doctors, doulas, nurses and therapists nationally.\nAs more patients seek culturally competent care \u2014 the acknowledgment of a patient's heritage, beliefs and values during treatment \u2014 a new wave of Black tech founders like Wisdom want to help. In the same way Uber Eats and Grubhub revolutionized food delivery, Black tech health startups across the United States want to change how people exercise, how they eat and how they communicate with doctors.\nInspired by their own experiences, plus those of their parents and grandparents, Black entrepreneurs are launching startups that aim to close the cultural gap in health care with technology \u2014 and create profitable businesses at the same time.\n\"One of the most exciting growth opportunities across health innovation is to back underrepresented founders building health companies focusing on underserved markets,\" said Unity Stoakes, president and co-founder of StartUp Health, a company headquartered in San Francisco that has invested in a number of health companies led by people of color. He said those leaders have \"an essential and powerful understanding of how to solve some of the biggest challenges in health care.\"\nPlatforms created by Black founders for Black people and communities of color continue to blossom because those entrepreneurs often see problems and solutions others might miss. Without diverse voices, entire categories and products simply would not exist in critical areas like health care, business experts say.\n\"We're really speaking to a need,\" said Kevin Dedner, 45, founder of the mental health startup Hurdle. \"Mission alone is not enough. You have to solve a problem.\"\nDedner's company, headquartered in Washington, D.C., pairs patients with therapists who \"honor culture instead of ignoring it,\" he said. He started the company three years ago, but more people turned to Hurdle after the killing of George Floyd.\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, Erica Plybeah, 33, is focused on providing transportation. Her company, MedHaul, works with providers and patients to secure low-cost rides to get people to and from their medical appointments. Caregivers, patients or providers fill out a form on MedHaul's website, then Plybeah's team helps them schedule a ride.\nWhile MedHaul is for everyone, Plybeah knows people of color, anyone with a low income and residents of rural areas are more likely to face transportation hurdles. She founded the company in 2017 after years of watching her mother take care of her grandmother, who had lost two limbs to Type 2 diabetes. They lived in the Mississippi Delta, where transportation options were scarce.",

            "Content": "Pediatric dermatologists who treat infantile hemangioma (IH) can consider nadolol as a noninferior \u2014 and possibly a better \u2014 alternative to the standard treatment propranolol, according to a study published in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\"In our experience, nadolol is preferable to propranolol given its observed efficacy and similar safety profile...[and] its more predictable metabolism that does not involve the liver,\" lead author Elena Pope, MD, told Medscape Medical News. \"In addition, the fact that nadolol is less lipophilic than propranolol makes it less likely to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and potentially affect the central nervous system,\" added Pope, who is head of the division of pediatric dermatology at the Hospital for Sick Children and professor of pediatric medicine at the University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nThe prospective double-blind, randomized noninferiority study was conducted between 2016 and 2020 at two tertiary academic pediatric dermatology clinics in Ontario, Canada. It included 71 infants with a corrected gestational age of 1 to 6 months whose hemangiomas were greater than 1.5 cm on the face or 3 cm or greater on another body part and had the potential to cause functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement.\nPatients were randomized to either nadolol (oral suspension, 10 mg/mL) or propranolol (oral suspension, 5 mg/mL) beginning at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day twice a day and titrated weekly by 0.5 mg/kg/day until the maximum dose of 2 mg/kg/day. The dose was then adjusted until week 24, based on patient weight and clinical response, after which parents could choose to continue the infant on the assigned medication or switch to the other one. Follow-up visits occurred every 2 months after that until week 52.\nFor the main study outcome, measured by visual analog scale (VAS) scores at week 24, the between-group differences of IH size and color from baseline were 8.8 and 17.1, respectively, in favor of the nadolol group, the researchers report, with similar results seen at week 52. Safety data were similar for both treatments, \"demonstrating that nadolol was noninferior to propranolol,\" they write.\nAdditionally, the mean size involution compared with baseline was 97.9% in the nadolol group and 89.1% in the propranolol group, and the mean color fading was 94.5% in the nadolol group compared with 80.5% in the propranolol group. During the study, nadolol was also \"59% faster in achieving 75% shrinkage of IH compared with propranolol (P = .02) and 105% faster in achieving 100% shrinkage (P = .07),\" they add.\n\"A considerable portion of patients experienced at least one mild adverse event (77.1% vs 94.4% at 0 to 24 weeks and 84.2% vs 74.2% at 24 to 52 weeks in the nadolol group vs the propranolol group, respectively), with a median of two in each intervention group,\" they noted, adding that while these numbers are high, they are similar to those in previous clinical trials.\n\"The efficacy data coupled with a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile and lower chance of crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier may make nadolol a favorable alternative intervention in patients with IHs,\" the authors conclude. However, they add that \"further studies are needed to prove superiority over propranolol.\"\nAsked to comment on the results, Ilona Frieden, MD, co-author of the American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Infantile Hemangiomas, said that while this is a \"very interesting study and deserves further consideration,\" the findings do not reach the level at which they would change guidelines. \"The vast majority of patients being treated with a systemic medication for IH are in fact getting propranolol,\" said Frieden, director of the Birthmarks & Vascular Anomalies Center at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Though this study \u2014 designed as a noninferiority study \u2014 does seem to show slightly better outcomes from nadolol versus propranolol...it is a relatively small study,\" she told Medscape Medical News. \"Infantile hemangiomas are a very heterogeneous group, and larger studies and longer-term outcome data would be needed to truly compare the two modalities of treatment.\"",

            "Content": "Ramy Sedhom, MD, a medical oncologist and a palliative care physician at Penn Medicine Princeton Health in Plainsboro, New Jersey, will always wonder if prior authorization refusals led to his patient's death.\nThe patient had advanced gastric cancer and the insurer initially denied a PET scan to rule out metastatic disease. When the scan was eventually allowed, it revealed that the cancer had spread.\nStandard treatment would have been difficult for the patient, an older individual with comorbidities. But Sedhom knew that a European study had reported equal efficacy and fewer side effects with a reduced chemotherapy regimen, and he thought that was the best approach in this situation.\nThe insurer disagreed with Sedhom's decision and, while the two argued, the patient's symptoms worsened. He was admitted to the hospital, where he experienced a decline in function, common for older patients. \"Long story short, he was never able to seek treatment and then transitioned to hospice,\" Sedhom said. \"It was one of those situations where there was a 3- to 4-week delay in what should have been standard care.\"\nThat course of events is not an outlier but everyday life for physicians trying to navigate insurers' prior authorization rules before they can treat their patients. Nearly 4 years after major organizations \u2014 American Hospital Association, America's Health Insurance Plans, American Medical Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and others \u2014 signed a consensus statement agreeing to improve the prior authorization process, physicians say little progress has been made.\nIndeed, 83% of physicians say that the number of prior authorizations required for prescription medications and medical services has increased over the last 5 years, according to survey results released earlier this year.\n\"It's decidedly worse \u2014 there's no question about it,\" said Andrew R. Spector, MD, a neurologist and sleep medicine specialist at Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina. \"Drugs that I used to get without prior authorizations now require them.\"\nWhen Vignesh I. Doraiswamy, MD, an internal medicine hospitalist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, discharged a patient with Clostridioides difficile infection, he followed clinical guidelines to prescribe vancomycin for 10 to 14 days. \"And the insurance company said, \"Well, yeah, we only authorize about 5 days,\" which just makes no sense,'\" Doraiswamy said. \"There's nowhere in any literature that says 5 days is sufficient. What worries me is that is the standard of care we are supposed to give and yet we are unable to.\"\nYash B. Jobanputra, MD, a cardiology fellow at Saint Vincent Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, laments that prior authorization is used in situations that simply do not make common sense. During his residency, a woman who had tested positive for the BRCA gene mutation with a strong family history of breast cancer needed a breast ultrasound and an MRI scan every 6 months to 1 year. Despite the documentation that she was at extremely high risk for developing breast cancer, he had to go through prior authorization every time she was due for new images.",

The gas also killed the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces.\n\"By combining cold plasma gas with acetyl donor molecules to improve its oxidation action, we found [the formulation] completely killed bacteria that are found in chronic wounds,\" lead author Endre J. Szili said in a press statement on the research, published in Applied Physics Letters.\n\"We investigated whether this same technology could be effective at killing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it appears that it is,\" said Szili, a senior research fellow and head of the Plasma Medicine Research Group at the Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Adelaide.\n\"To the best of knowledge our study is the first report on the use of plasma in combination with acetyl donor molecules,\" the authors note.\nCold plasma is a low-temperature, electrically generated, partially ionized glow-discharge that is tolerable to human tissue. Although the plasma gas can kill bacteria, the treatment can lose effectiveness against notoriously resistant biofilms.\nTo try to improve its efficacy in killing bacteria, Szili and colleagues combined the cold plasma with acetyl donor molecules and found the combination generated hydrogen peroxide and released peracetic acid, enhancing the ability to destroy resistant bacteria through a multipronged action.\n\"The combination of the cold plasma with acetyl donors produces additional oxidants that are less affected by the bacteria's antioxidant defense mechanisms,\" Szili explained to Medscape Medical News.\nThe formulation's synergistic effect \"can be used to target a broad spectrum of microbes and infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses,\" he added.\nGas Killed Bacteria in Foot Ulcers, COVID-19 Virus\nFor the study, the authors tested the strategy in lab experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responsible for infections in the blood, lungs, and other areas after surgery, and Staphylococcus aureus, linked to potentially life-threatening blood poisoning and pneumonia.\nThey found that, while the use of cold plasma alone was effective against P. aeruginosa, it had minimal effect on S. aureus. However, the combination treatment showed successful eradication of both types of bacteria.\n\"This is very significant for diabetic patients who have foot ulcers that are hard to heal,\" Szili said in the press statement.\nSimilar trends were observed when the virucidal activities of the formulation were tested against SARS-CoV-2.\nThe experiments showed that the plasma-activated blend effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load by 50%-84%, raising the possibility of its use in disinfecting surfaces such in hospitals or air-conditioning systems.",

Still, he noted, no specific intervention exists and it's becoming increasingly common. \"By the time we hit 60 years of age, more people in society have stage B heart failure than a normal heart.\"\nPreclinical heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the dominant form of preclinical HF, is largely driven by CV compliance abnormalities. Sacubitril/valsartan, through preservation of natriuretic peptide (NP), may improve CV compliance, especially if introduced early in the disease process, McDonald said.\nEarlier this year, the ARNI was granted an expanded indication, making it the first drug in the United States indicated for chronic heart failure not specifically characterized by EF.\nThe phase 2 PARABLE trial randomly assigned 250 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive sacubitril/valsartan 50 mg twice daily titrated to 200 mg twice daily, or valsartan 40 mg twice daily titrated to 160 mg twice daily.\nThe patients were older than 40 years of age (mean, 71.8 years; 61.6% male) with treated hypertension and/or diabetes and elevated NP levels (B-type NP, 20-280 pg/mL or N-terminal pro-B-type NP, 100-1000 pg/mL) and abnormal left atrial volume index (above 28 mL/m2).\nAt baseline, the left atrial volume index (LAVI) was 33.2 mL/m2 using Doppler echocardiography and 50 mL/m2 using cardiac MRI. \"The discrepancy you see with cardiac MRI is a notable feature in the literature, but maybe something that's not as widely appreciated as it should be,\" McDonald said.\nThe primary outcome of change in maximal LAVI over 18 months by cardiac MRI was 6.9 mL/m2 with sacubitril/valsartan vs 0.7 mL/m2 with valsartan alone (adjusted P < .0001).\nSacubitril/valsartan was also associated with a significant change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (7.1 mL/m2 vs 1.4% mL/m2; adjusted P < .01).\nNotably, neither change was \"picked up by the echocardiographic measurements made at the same time,\" McDonald observed.",

New York City has also required vaccinations for city workers and for indoor dining, for example.\nBut vaccination rates are lower in western New York, the Finger Lakes and other rural communities north of New York City and its surrounding suburbs: as low as 40% in Allegany County, 47% in Wyoming County, and 49% in Yates and Seneca counties.",

The nurses' complaint alleges that the European Union (EU) along with the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, and Singapore are preventing vaccines from getting into the arms of citizens in those countries and are favoring pharmaceutical company profits over human life.\nThe EU and offending countries, according to the complaint, have blocked a temporary waiver of corporate pharmaceutical intellectual property rights under the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the complaint states. The South African and Indian governments proposed the waiver at the WTO last year to speed up the manufacture and distribution of COVID vaccines to low- and moderate-income countries, according to the complaint. More than 45% of the world's population still has not received even one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the complaint alleges.\n\"These countries have violated our rights and the rights of our patients \u2015 and caused the loss of countless lives [through] continued opposition to the TRIPS waiver...resulting in the violation of human rights of peoples across the world,\" according to an NNU press release.\n\"COVID-19 cases continue to soar in numerous parts of the world, while pharmaceutical companies and governments have failed to ensure that critical treatments and vaccines are distributed equitably in order to respond to the pandemic,\" the nurses' unions wrote. \"High-income countries have procured upwards of 7 billion confirmed vaccine doses, while low-income countries have only been able to procure approximately 300 million doses. This has created what public health advocates around the world have described as 'vaccine apartheid.' \"\nCortez said of the lower-income countries, \"We have been sending them vaccines. They should not rely on charity. They should be able to manufacturer their own vaccines.\"\nThe nurses' complaint addressed Tlaleng Mofokeng, MBChB, a physician and the UN's Special Rapporteur on Physical and Mental Health, calling on her to lead an investigation into the nurses' alleged human rights violations. The WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva at which the issue could have been discussed this week was postponed because of the Omicron variant.\n\"We are hoping whenever they reconvene, the committee will act on this under the leadership of Dr Mofokeng,\" Cortez said.\nMofokeng supported the nurses' position, according to the release. \"The nurses' core demand is one I share: States have a collective responsibility to use all available means to facilitate faster access to vaccines, including by introducing a temporary waiver of relevant intellectual property rights under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement),\" she said. \"Nurses and health care workers have been on the front line keeping us safe and have witnessed the most painful and heart-wrenching effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Their evident commitment to the right to physical and mental health provides them with moral authority.\"\nUS President Joe Biden endorsed the waiver in May, but the coordinated campaign by the nurses' unions may be able to convince the UN to take the effort to the next level, Cortez said. \"Hopefully we will create a louder voice and have a much bigger impact\" and persuade the UN committee that it \"should be looking out for the welfare of the world.\"\nFor more news, follow Medscape on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.",

            "Content": "Health experts across the globe are raising concerns about the newly discovered COVID-19 variant, Omicron, which was first identified in South Africa. The country's minister of health announced last week that the variant had already spread in different areas of the country. \nThe next day, the World Health Organization designated Omicron a \"variant of concern.\" \nPresident Joe Biden echoed this statement at a news briefing today, but he stressed that the new variant is a \"cause for concern, not a cause for panic.\"\nCOVID-19 vaccine makers are looking into the vaccine's protection against the new variant.\n\"The mutations in the Omicron variant are concerning, and for several days, we have been moving as fast as possible to execute our strategy to address this variant,\" St\u00e9phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, said in a statement. \nPfizer says that data about its vaccine's protection against Omicron should be released in the coming weeks. \nA number of countries are making efforts to prevent the global spread of Omicron. The US is just one of a number of countries that have placed new travel restrictions on South Africa and its neighboring countries. \nSo what makes Omicron different from other COVID-19 variants? And how concerned should we be? Health experts help us break it down. \nWhat Do We Know So Far? \nThere is a lot that we don't know about Omicron, including whether it causes more severe illness than other variants, says Leana Wen, MD, MSc, an emergency doctor and public health professor at George Washington University in Washington, DC.\nBut we do know that it's a variant with an unusually high number of mutations, or changes in the virus' genetic material. \nEarly evidence also shows that the Omicron variant may spread easier than other COVID-19 variants, she says. \n\"That's very concerning because Delta, which is the dominant variant here in the US and around the world, is already extremely contagious. So, if this is even more contagious, it could displace the Delta variant,\" says Wen.\nIs the Omicron Variant in the US?\nAs of right now, no cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in the US. \nEither way, you should stay calm, says William Schaffner, MD, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\"Even if it were to be here in the United States, the dominant \u2014 the 99% that is causing disease in your community today \u2014 that strain is Delta,\" he says. \"And we know the vaccines work against Delta.\"\nWill COVID-19 Vaccines Work Against Omicron?\n\"We don't know whether the large number of mutations renders the vaccines less effective against this variant,\" says Wen. \"Although many scientists believe \u2014 especially with a booster shot \u2014 that it's not going to render the vaccines ineffective.\"",

Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said the state won't be \"defenseless\" if everyone wears masks indoors, gets vaccinated, gets tested, washes their hands and stays home when sick.\n\"Mark my words, we're going to see a surge in the next five days,\" Hochul said.\nAnd Dr. Dave Chokshi, the commissioner, said he is \"strongly recommending\" that all New Yorkers wear masks \"at all times when indoors and in a public setting like at your grocery or in a building lobby, offices and retail stores.\"\nThe guidance was in line with the recommendation issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in July that even vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where the virus is surging.\nMuch is still not known about the omicron variant, which was identified last week by researchers in South Africa, including whether it is more contagious than other coronavirus variants, or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.\nCases of the omicron variant have been found in countries including Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, but no cases have yet been detected in the United States.\nMayor Bill de Blasio said that while there have been no cases of the omicron variant reported in New York City, \"it is very likely there will be.\"\nChokshi, who joined de Blasio at a virtual news briefing, said the delta variant of the virus accounts for 98% of the coronavirus samples from New York City that are being sequenced now.\nHochul said she wasn't ready to announce any new sweeping COVID-19 protocols, like restrictions on visits at nursing homes.\nShe said she supports recent announcements by Erie County officials, who have warned that the county could start requiring vaccine mandates for indoor dining if rates keep surging.\nVaccination rates are increasing overall in New York, fueled in part by a mandate for health care workers to get vaccinated. New York City has also required vaccinations for city workers and for indoor dining, for example.\nBut vaccination rates are lower in western New York, the Finger Lakes and other rural communities north of New York City and its surrounding suburbs: as low as 40% in Allegany County, 47% in Wyoming County, and 49% in Yates and Seneca counties.",

The gas also killed the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces.\n\"By combining cold plasma gas with acetyl donor molecules to improve its oxidation action, we found [the formulation] completely killed bacteria that are found in chronic wounds,\" lead author Endre J. Szili said in a press statement on the research, published in Applied Physics Letters.\n\"We investigated whether this same technology could be effective at killing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it appears that it is,\" said Szili, a senior research fellow and head of the Plasma Medicine Research Group at the Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Adelaide.\n\"To the best of knowledge our study is the first report on the use of plasma in combination with acetyl donor molecules,\" the authors note.\nCold plasma is a low-temperature, electrically generated, partially ionized glow-discharge that is tolerable to human tissue. Although the plasma gas can kill bacteria, the treatment can lose effectiveness against notoriously resistant biofilms.\nTo try to improve its efficacy in killing bacteria, Szili and colleagues combined the cold plasma with acetyl donor molecules and found the combination generated hydrogen peroxide and released peracetic acid, enhancing the ability to destroy resistant bacteria through a multipronged action.\n\"The combination of the cold plasma with acetyl donors produces additional oxidants that are less affected by the bacteria's antioxidant defense mechanisms,\" Szili explained to Medscape Medical News.\nThe formulation's synergistic effect \"can be used to target a broad spectrum of microbes and infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses,\" he added.\nGas Killed Bacteria in Foot Ulcers, COVID-19 Virus\nFor the study, the authors tested the strategy in lab experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responsible for infections in the blood, lungs, and other areas after surgery, and Staphylococcus aureus, linked to potentially life-threatening blood poisoning and pneumonia.\nThey found that, while the use of cold plasma alone was effective against P. aeruginosa, it had minimal effect on S. aureus. However, the combination treatment showed successful eradication of both types of bacteria.\n\"This is very significant for diabetic patients who have foot ulcers that are hard to heal,\" Szili said in the press statement.\nSimilar trends were observed when the virucidal activities of the formulation were tested against SARS-CoV-2.\nThe experiments showed that the plasma-activated blend effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load by 50%-84%, raising the possibility of its use in disinfecting surfaces such in hospitals or air-conditioning systems.",

Pedersen, MD, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.\n\"This randomized controlled trial is the largest to date comparing such an early MI rule-out strategy with the current standard of care. We showed that accelerated rule-out of MI, using prehospital copeptin and the first in-hospital high-sensitivity troponin T test, significantly reduced length of stay,\" Pedersen concluded.\n\"This study provides important data on the safety of early discharge after accelerated rule-out in a large cohort of largely unselected patients with suspected MI,\" he said.\n\"Our study is the first randomized trial to evaluate a strategy where all necessary biomarker results are available to the doctor already when first attending the patient, potentially allowing for an immediate discharge,\" he added.\nHe also pointed out that since copeptin is a marker of acute endogenous stress, normal levels may also allow rule out other life-threatening conditions.\nBut outside commentators pointed out that practice is moving toward earlier use of high-sensitivity troponin to rule out MI in hospital and they questioned whether measuring copeptin as well would add much information in this situation.\nFlooding Emergency Departments\nIn his presentation, Pedersen noted that chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and patients with suspected MI are flooding emergency departments and cardiac departments worldwide. Rapid rule-out of MI is needed to reduce the burden on the healthcare systems, he explained, but present rule-out strategies are limited by the late release of cardiac troponin in MI and the frequent need for repeated troponin measurements.\nThe biomarker copeptin has been promising in the early rule-out of acute MI, being released early and in significant amounts, with levels peaking at about 2 hours after symptom onset, Pedersen reported.  \nBecause of this early release, the optimal timing for copeptin measurement is as early as possible, preferably before the patient arrives at the hospital. In contrast, troponin should be measured at a later timepoint, after arrival to the hospital, he said.\nThe purpose of the AROMI study was to evaluate the safety and efficiency of an accelerated dual-marker rule-out strategy, where prehospital copeptin is combined with in-hospital high-sensitivity troponin T.",

The United Kingdom's drug regulator authorized use of the medication in early November. The company said it expected to distribute the medication globally by the end of 2021.\nLast month, two Indian drug companies halted late-stage clinical trials of a generic version of molnupiravir after the studies failed to find any benefit to patients with moderate COVID-19. Trials in patients with milder symptoms are still ongoing.\nOn Saturday, The New England Journal of Medicine postponed its planned early release of the molnupiravir study results, citing \"new information.\"\nThe medication is designed to be given as four pills taken every 12 hours for 5 days. It's most effective when taken within the first few days of new symptoms, something that requires convenient and affordable testing.\nThe new results seem to put molnupiravir far below the effectiveness of existing treatments.\nThe infused monoclonal antibody cocktail REGEN-COV, which the FDA has already authorized for emergency use, is about 85% effective at preventing hospitalization or death in patients who are at risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, and it appears to be just as effective in people who already have antibodies against COVID-19, which is why it is being given to both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, the FDA said.\nIn early November, Pfizer said its experimental antiviral pill Paxlovid cut the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%.\nIn briefing documents posted ahead of an advisory committee meeting on Tuesday, the FDA highlights other potential safety issues with the Merck drug, which works by causing the virus to make mistakes as it copies itself, eventually causing the virus to mutate itself to death.\nThe agency has asked the advisory committee to weigh in on the right patient population for the drug: Should pregnant women get it? Could the drug harm a developing fetus?\nShould vaccinated people with breakthrough infections get it? Would it work for them? People with reduced immune function are more likely to get a breakthrough infection. They're also more likely to shed virus for a longer period of time, making them perfect incubators for variants. What could happen if we give this type of patient a drug that increases mutations?\nAnd what about mutations caused by the medication? Could they increase the potential for more variants? The agency concluded the risk of this happening was low.\nIn animal studies, the drug impacted bone formation. For this reason, the agency has agreed with the drug company that molnupiravir should not be given to anyone under the age of 18.\nAside from these concerns, the FDA says there were no major safety issues among people who took part in the clinical trial, though they acknowledge that number is small.\nSources\nFDA: \"Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting,\" Nov. 30, 2021.\nNews releases, Merck, Oct. 1, 2021 and Nov. 26, 2021.",

In a pooled analysis, etrolizumab was not superior to adalimumab, the investigators report.\nHICKORY was a placebo-controlled induction and maintenance study of patients with previous exposure to TNF inhibitors. In this trial, a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with etrolizumab achieved remission at 14 weeks compared with placebo; however, there was no significant difference between groups in remission at 66 weeks among patients who responded at 14 weeks.\nGARDENIA was a randomized study comparing etrolizumab with infliximab in patients with moderately to severely active UC with no prior TNF-inhibitor exposure.\nIn this study, etrolizumab was not superior to infliximab on the primary endpoint (the proportion of patients who had both clinical response at week 10 and clinical remission at week 54). From a clinical viewpoint, etrolizumab performed similarly to infliximab, the investigators report.\nLAUREL was a randomized, placebo-controlled, maintenance study comparing etrolizumab with placebo in patients with moderately to severely active UC with no prior TNF-inhibitor exposure.\nIn this study, there were no significant differences between maintenance etrolizumab and placebo in the primary endpoint of remission at 62 weeks among who had a clinical response at 10 weeks.\nIn all five studies, etrolizumab was well tolerated with no new safety signals.\nThe comment authors offer several caveats to these trials for consideration.\n\"Although remission rates with etrolizumab were lower than originally anticipated based on phase 2 data, the induction data are consistent with a clinical remission rate in TNF inhibitor-naive (HIBISCUS I and II) and TNF inhibitor-exposed patients (HICKORY) of approximately 20%,\" they point out.\n\"The finding that etrolizumab, while not superior to placebo in HIBISCUS, LAUREL, and HICKORY was associated with similar proportions of patients reaching remission as with TNF inhibitors in HIBISCUS (adalimumab; exploratory endpoint) and GARDENIA (infliximab; primary endpoint) is also encouraging,\" they say.\nDrs. Agrawal and Verstockt add that \"some reasons postulated for the negative results include an ambitious effect size assumption and high placebo response rates. A low dose of etrolizumab (105 mg subcutaneous once every 4 weeks) was studied across all trials.\"\nThe studies also lacked information on baseline integrin alpha-E expression as a predictive biomarker.\n\"Moving forward, recruiting a molecularly enriched subgroup of patients could result in a significantly larger difference between treatment groups and allow for a smaller sample size (and reduced associated resources) without compromising on power,\" Drs. Agrawal and Verstockt suggest.\n\"Although etrolizumab is currently far from approval as a treatment option in ulcerative colitis, the current data are provocative and highlight questions to be addressed in post-hoc analyses, and data from Crohn's disease trials (BERGAMOT and JUNIPER) are awaited,\" they add.\nSOURCE: https://bit.ly/30PKD6o, https://bit.ly/3CL04tK, https://bit.ly/30O6ICm, https://bit.ly/3cXnORf, https://bit.ly/3l2Jlwh The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology, online November 16, 2021.",

They compared the CT diagnosis with the final clinical diagnosis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced low- vs. standard-dose CT.\nOf the 856 patients receiving diagnostic CT, 454 received a low radiation dose and 402 patients received a standard dose. The overall accuracy of low-dose vs. standard-dose CT scans in identifying patients with and without acute appendicitis was 98.0% and 98.5%, respectively. In patients with a BMI under 30 kg/m2, the accuracy was 98.2% for the 434 low-dose patients and 98.6% for the 210 standard-dose patients (P=1.0).\nFor all patients, the corresponding accuracy for differentiating between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis was 90.3% and 87.6%.

Representation by women as chairpersons of the board of directors at health systems and health insurers was just slightly better: 17.5% of chairpersons at health systems are women, and 21.3% of boards of directors have chairpersons who are women.\nThe study also found that having a woman as a health system CEO was associated with a higher proportion of women on the board of directors or in roles as senior executives. Having more women in senior leadership roles at health insurance companies was also associated with increased representation of women as CEOs, per the study.\nResearchers also learned that more than half (58.1%) of the leadership positions in the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are held by women.\nBismarck Odei, MD, lead author of the study, told Medscape Medical News that he was most surprised that \"the healthcare system in one of the largest populated countries in the world, where women form a slight majority, has so few women leaders influencing the day-to-day healthcare realities of women.\"\nStill, he points to the gender diversity of healthcare organizations' boards of directors as \"not a trivial statistic.\"\n\"It may be one of the more important parameters that can increase the representation of women in the CEO position across healthcare organizations,\" said Odei, a radiation oncology resident at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.\nHealthcare Organizations Are More Diverse Than Fortune 500\nAs a benchmark, women are more likely to serve as CEO at healthcare organizations than at Fortune 500 companies.

            "Content": "Ramy Sedhom, MD, a medical oncologist and a palliative care physician at Penn Medicine Princeton Health in Plainsboro, New Jersey, will always wonder if prior authorization refusals led to his patient's death.\nThe patient had advanced gastric cancer and the insurer initially denied a PET scan to rule out metastatic disease. When the scan was eventually allowed, it revealed that the cancer had spread.\nStandard treatment would have been difficult for the patient, an older individual with comorbidities. But Sedhom knew that a European study had reported equal efficacy and fewer side effects with a reduced chemotherapy regimen, and he thought that was the best approach in this situation.\nThe insurer disagreed with Sedhom's decision and, while the two argued, the patient's symptoms worsened. He was admitted to the hospital, where he experienced a decline in function, common for older patients. \"Long story short, he was never able to seek treatment and then transitioned to hospice,\" Sedhom said. \"It was one of those situations where there was a 3- to 4-week delay in what should have been standard care.\"\nThat course of events is not an outlier but everyday life for physicians trying to navigate insurers' prior authorization rules before they can treat their patients. Nearly 4 years after major organizations \u2014 American Hospital Association, America's Health Insurance Plans, American Medical Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and others \u2014 signed a consensus statement agreeing to improve the prior authorization process, physicians say little progress has been made.\nIndeed, 83% of physicians say that the number of prior authorizations required for prescription medications and medical services has increased over the last 5 years, according to survey results released earlier this year.\n\"It's decidedly worse \u2014 there's no question about it,\" said Andrew R. Spector, MD, a neurologist and sleep medicine specialist at Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina. \"Drugs that I used to get without prior authorizations now require them.\"\nWhen Vignesh I. Doraiswamy, MD, an internal medicine hospitalist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, discharged a patient with Clostridioides difficile infection, he followed clinical guidelines to prescribe vancomycin for 10 to 14 days. \"And the insurance company said, \"Well, yeah, we only authorize about 5 days,\" which just makes no sense,'\" Doraiswamy said. \"There's nowhere in any literature that says 5 days is sufficient. What worries me is that is the standard of care we are supposed to give and yet we are unable to.\"\nYash B. Jobanputra, MD, a cardiology fellow at Saint Vincent Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, laments that prior authorization is used in situations that simply do not make common sense. During his residency, a woman who had tested positive for the BRCA gene mutation with a strong family history of breast cancer needed a breast ultrasound and an MRI scan every 6 months to 1 year. Despite the documentation that she was at extremely high risk for developing breast cancer, he had to go through prior authorization every time she was due for new images.",

The gas also killed the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces.\n\"By combining cold plasma gas with acetyl donor molecules to improve its oxidation action, we found [the formulation] completely killed bacteria that are found in chronic wounds,\" lead author Endre J. Szili said in a press statement on the research, published in Applied Physics Letters.\n\"We investigated whether this same technology could be effective at killing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it appears that it is,\" said Szili, a senior research fellow and head of the Plasma Medicine Research Group at the Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Adelaide.\n\"To the best of knowledge our study is the first report on the use of plasma in combination with acetyl donor molecules,\" the authors note.\nCold plasma is a low-temperature, electrically generated, partially ionized glow-discharge that is tolerable to human tissue. Although the plasma gas can kill bacteria, the treatment can lose effectiveness against notoriously resistant biofilms.\nTo try to improve its efficacy in killing bacteria, Szili and colleagues combined the cold plasma with acetyl donor molecules and found the combination generated hydrogen peroxide and released peracetic acid, enhancing the ability to destroy resistant bacteria through a multipronged action.\n\"The combination of the cold plasma with acetyl donors produces additional oxidants that are less affected by the bacteria's antioxidant defense mechanisms,\" Szili explained to Medscape Medical News.\nThe formulation's synergistic effect \"can be used to target a broad spectrum of microbes and infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses,\" he added.\nGas Killed Bacteria in Foot Ulcers, COVID-19 Virus\nFor the study, the authors tested the strategy in lab experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responsible for infections in the blood, lungs, and other areas after surgery, and Staphylococcus aureus, linked to potentially life-threatening blood poisoning and pneumonia.\nThey found that, while the use of cold plasma alone was effective against P. aeruginosa, it had minimal effect on S. aureus. However, the combination treatment showed successful eradication of both types of bacteria.\n\"This is very significant for diabetic patients who have foot ulcers that are hard to heal,\" Szili said in the press statement.\nSimilar trends were observed when the virucidal activities of the formulation were tested against SARS-CoV-2.\nThe experiments showed that the plasma-activated blend effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load by 50%-84%, raising the possibility of its use in disinfecting surfaces such in hospitals or air-conditioning systems.",

They compared the CT diagnosis with the final clinical diagnosis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced low- vs. standard-dose CT.\nOf the 856 patients receiving diagnostic CT, 454 received a low radiation dose and 402 patients received a standard dose. The overall accuracy of low-dose vs. standard-dose CT scans in identifying patients with and without acute appendicitis was 98.0% and 98.5%, respectively.

Online availability appears to be a boon to attendance, with a record 9325 registrants for the 2020 symposium, held only virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe meeting will have an app available, which can be accessed by searching \"San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium\" (Google Play for Android, Apple for iOS) and downloading, or by clicking here from a desktop computer.\nArteaga provided a sneak peek of the most exciting research being presented at the upcoming meeting.\nOn the Horizon for Advanced Breast Cancer\nA \"very important\" study of an investigational oral agent employed in heavily pretreated postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor\u2013positive (ER+) advanced breast cancer headlines the meeting.\nThis international, multicenter trial could have \"practice-changing implications,\" Arteaga told Medscape Medical News.\nThe phase 3 EMERALD trial (abstract GS2-02) pits elacestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), against standard endocrine therapy (fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor) in patients with metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after treatment with at least one endocrine therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.\nThe trial is important because many patients with breast cancer have estrogen receptor mutations, which are a \"major mechanism of [drug] resistance\" and thus progression on earlier therapy, Arteaga said.\nElacestrant is in good company among a plethora of oral SERDs under investigation in advanced breast cancer; however, currently, fulvestrant \u2014 which requires an intramuscular injection in the buttocks every month \u2014 is the only approved SERD.\n\"There's plenty of preclinical data that suggest that these drugs [SERDs] may have activity against these mutant forms of the receptor, which occur in up to 40% of patients with advanced ER+ breast cancer,\" he explained.\nResearchers will present data on two primary outcome measures from the phase 3 trial: progression-free survival (PFS) based on mutations of the estrogen receptor 1 gene (ESR1-mut) and PFS in all subjects regardless of ESR1 status.\nIn addition to the EMERALD trial, PADA-1 (abstract GS3-05) is another important randomized, phase 3 trial focused on treating estrogen receptor mutations in patients with metastatic disease, said Arteaga.\nThe trial has enrolled patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer who received an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane) and the CDK 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib as first-line therapy.\nIn step 1 of the trial, approximately 1000 patients were screened for circulating blood ESR1 mutation detection at regular intervals while being treated with palbociclib and an aromatase inhibitor in a continuous scheme until tumor progression or ESR1 mutation detection.",

The organization estimates that there will be more than 21,000 new cases and more than 13,000 deaths in 2021.\nCurrently, surgeons use preoperative imaging as well as visual inspection of tumors under normal light and examination by touch to identify ovarian cancer lesions.\nPafolacianine offers a new tool to enhance surgeons' ability \"to identify deadly ovarian tumors that may otherwise go undetected,\" Alex Gorovets, MD, deputy director of the Office of Specialty Medicine in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a press statement.\nOvarian cancer often causes the body to overproduce the folate receptor protein in cell membranes. Pafolacianine, employed with a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system cleared by the FDA for use alongside the drug, binds to and illuminates these proteins under fluorescent light, \"boosting surgeons' ability to identify the cancerous tissue,\" the agency in a statement.\nThe safety and effectiveness of pafolacianine was evaluated in a randomized, multi-center, open-label study of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer or with high clinical suspicion of ovarian cancer. Of the 134 women undergoing surgery who received a dose of pafolacianine and were evaluated under both normal and fluorescent light, 26.9% had at least one cancerous lesion detected that was not observed by standard visual or tactile inspection.\nThe most common side effects of pafolacianine were infusion-related reactions, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, chest discomfort, itching, and hypersensitivity.\nPafolacianine may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The use of folate, folic acid, or folate-containing supplements should be avoided within 48 hours before administration of pafolacianine. \nThe FDA also cautioned about the possible risk of image interpretation errors, including false negatives and false positives, with the use of the new drug and near-infrared fluorescence imaging system.\nThe FDA previously granted pafolacianine orphan-drug, priority, and fast track designations.\nFor more from Medscape Oncology, join us on  Twitter  and  Facebook",

            "Content": "The Oncology Care Model (OCM) led to modest savings per episode of care but, when factoring in monthly and performance-based payments, resulted in an overall loss of more than $315 million to Medicare, according to one of the most thorough studies of the program.\nThe analysis, published on November 9 in JAMA, found that per episode savings of $297 during the first 3 years of the model's implementation were offset by $704 in payments for enhanced services to 201 participating practices. When considering the $160 monthly and performance-based payments, the authors estimated a net loss of $315.6 million between 2016 and 2019. In addition, the researchers found no significant differences in the use of most services, quality, or patient experience.\n\"[The OCM] hasn't reached the hoped-for results \u2015 savings with stable or improved quality \u2015 that would allow CMS [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] to expand it nationally,\" Nancy Keating, MD, MPH, professor of health care policy and medicine in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, Boston, and lead author of the recent JAMA study, told Medscape Medical News. \"That means CMS needs to take what they learned from OCM and develop and test new models.\"\nThe OCM represents the largest alternative payment model, rolled out by CMS in 2016 to address value-based payment for cancer care. More than 3200 oncologists and 201 physician practices voluntarily entered the program, which includes financial and performance accountability for 6-month episodes of care for beneficiaries with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.\nSince its implementation, studies assessing the success of the program have yielded mixed results.\nA 2018 analysis, for instance, found that one large community practice saved Medicare $3 million over a year after adopting the OCM.\nBut a study published earlier this year found that while community practices experienced lower drug costs in lung and prostate cancer and lower office-based costs after implementing the program, the difference was not statistically significant when accounting for all costs.\nAnother recent study found cost reductions for all cancers, but again those savings were offset by administrative expenses. In this study, the OCM led to a $155 million net loss to Medicare over 4 years.\nInside the New Analysis\nIn the latest study, Keating and colleagues evaluated the association of the OCM with changes in Medicare spending, utilization, quality, and patient experience during the first 3 years after implementation.\nUsing claims for Medicare Parts A, B, and D, the researchers looked at utilization and payments for hospitalizations, emergency and office visits, chemotherapy, supportive care, and imaging as well as quality measures \u2014 such as chemotherapy-associated hospitalizations, emergency visits, end-of-life care, and survival \u2014 and patient experience. The study included 987,332 episodes among the 201 OCM practices and 1,122,597 episodes from 534 practices not participating in the program.",

            "Content": "For the first time, a product is available specifically for use in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumors.\nThe product is an intravenous formulation of nanoparticle albumin-bound nab-sirolimus (Fyarro) from Aadi Biosciences. The company announced on November 23 that the drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nAlthough sirolimus and other oral mTOR inhibitors are used off label for the condition, Fyarro is the first medication to be approved specifically for the rare tumor, a form of soft tissue sarcoma that the company estimates strikes about 100\u2013300 people in the US annually, predominantly women.\nThe company anticipates its new formulation \"will become a standard of care\" for the condition.\nAadi is planning a first quarter 2022 launch. The wholesale acquisition cost for a month of treatment will be approximately $39,000, a company executive said on an investors call.\nIn the new formulation, the goal of binding sirolimus to albumin is to deliver higher concentrations of the drug to the tumor with less toxicity. Aadi founder and CEO Neil Desai, PhD, helped invent nab technology and was a driver behind its first clinical application, nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane).\nThe product was approved on the basis of results from an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial in 34 patients, 31 of whom were evaluable for efficacy. These patients had not been previously treated with an mTOR inhibitor.\nThe trial, dubbed AMPECT, was the first prospective study in malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (mPEComas).\nThe overall response rate was 39%; all 12 responses were partial at first, but two converted to complete responses, one after 11 months of treatment and the other after 34 months.\nMedian progression-free survival was 10.6 months and median overall survival 40.8 months. Median duration of response was not reached after a median follow-up of 36 months.\nBy way of comparison, a recent series of 40 malignant PEComa patients treated with oral mTOR inhibitors \u2015 most often sirolimus \u2015 reported a response rate of 40% and median progression-free survival of 9 months.\nAMPECT investigators said their study \"provides evidence that nab-sirolimus may offer an important benefit\" over oral alternatives.\nThere's been no direct clinical comparison but nab-sirolimus \"has a distinct pharmacologic profile and pharmacokinetics\" with \"significantly higher tumor growth inhibition, higher intratumoral drug accumulation, and greater mTOR target suppression,\" said the study team, led by Andrew Wagner, MD, PhD, an oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston.\nThere were no drug-related grade 4 adverse events or deaths in AMPECT, and no new mTOR inhibitor safety signals.\nMore than half of patients developed stomatitis, infections, fatigue, and rash. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities that occurred in more than 10% included lymphocytopenia, increased glucose, and decreased potassium. There was one instance each of grade 3 acute kidney injury, acute coronary syndrome, edema, and pancytopenia.\nAbout a third of patients required dose reductions. Three patients stopped treatment entirely because of anemia, noninfectious cystitis, and pneumonitis.\nTSC2 mutations related to mTOR pathway overactivation \u2015 a driver of malignant PEComa \u2015 were a strong predictor of response in AMPECT, while the absence of pS6 mutations, which reflects a lack of activation, strongly predicted negative response.\nThe median age of the study participants was 60 years, and over 80% of the patients were women. Primary tumors were most often in the uterus, pelvis, or retroperitoneum. The lungs were the most common site of metastases.\nDosing in the trial was 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, which is the approved dosing. Median time to nab-sirolimus response was 1.4 months.\nAMPECT was funded by Aadi Bioscience. Wagner reported research funding from the company. Several authors are employees with stock in Aadi, including Desai, who also holds patents on the technology. Other authors reported research funding and/or being a consultant for the company.\nM.

Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said the state won't be \"defenseless\" if everyone wears masks indoors, gets vaccinated, gets tested, washes their hands and stays home when sick.\n\"Mark my words, we're going to see a surge in the next five days,\" Hochul said.\nAnd Dr. Dave Chokshi, the commissioner, said he is \"strongly recommending\" that all New Yorkers wear masks \"at all times when indoors and in a public setting like at your grocery or in a building lobby, offices and retail stores.\"\nThe guidance was in line with the recommendation issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in July that even vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where the virus is surging.\nMuch is still not known about the omicron variant, which was identified last week by researchers in South Africa, including whether it is more contagious than other coronavirus variants, or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.\nCases of the omicron variant have been found in countries including Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, but no cases have yet been detected in the United States.\nMayor Bill de Blasio said that while there have been no cases of the omicron variant reported in New York City, \"it is very likely there will be.\"\nChokshi, who joined de Blasio at a virtual news briefing, said the delta variant of the virus accounts for 98% of the coronavirus samples from New York City that are being sequenced now.\nHochul said she wasn't ready to announce any new sweeping COVID-19 protocols, like restrictions on visits at nursing homes.\nShe said she supports recent announcements by Erie County officials, who have warned that the county could start requiring vaccine mandates for indoor dining if rates keep surging.\nVaccination rates are increasing overall in New York, fueled in part by a mandate for health care workers to get vaccinated. New York City has also required vaccinations for city workers and for indoor dining, for example.\nBut vaccination rates are lower in western New York, the Finger Lakes and other rural communities north of New York City and its surrounding suburbs: as low as 40% in Allegany County, 47% in Wyoming County, and 49% in Yates and Seneca counties.",

The treatment, maribavir (Livtencity), is approved for adults and children 12 years and older who weigh at least 35 kg (77 pounds).\nThere are an estimated 200,000 adult transplants every year globally. CMV, a type of herpes virus, is one of the most common infections in transplant patients, occurring in 16% to 56% of solid organ transplant recipients and 30% to 70% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, according to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, the company that manufactures Livtencity. For immunosuppressed transplant patients, CMV infection can lead to complications that include loss of the transplanted or organ or even death.\n\"Cytomegalovirus infections that are resistant or do not respond to available drugs are of even greater concern,\" John Farley, MD, MPH, the director of the Office of Infectious Diseases in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. \"Today's approval helps meet a significant unmet medical need by providing a treatment option for this patient population.\"\nLivtencity, which is taken orally, works by preventing the activity of the enzyme responsible for virus replication. The approval, announced November 23, was based on a phase 3 clinical trial that compared Livtencity with conventional antiviral treatments in the achievement of CMV DNA concentration levels below what is measurable in transplant patients with CMV infection that is refractory or treatment-resistant. After 8 weeks, of the 235 patients who received Livtencity, 56% achieved this primary endpoint, compared with 24% of the 117 patients who received conventional antiviral treatments, the press release says.\nThe most reported adverse reactions of Livtencity were taste disturbance, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue.\n\"We are grateful for the contributions of the patients and clinicians who participated in our clinical trials, as well as the dedication of our scientists and researchers,\" said Ramona Sequeira, President of the Takeda's US Business Unit and Global Portfolio Commercialization, in a statement. \"People undergoing transplants have a lengthy and complex healthcare journey; with the approval of this treatment, we're proud to offer these individuals a new oral antiviral to fight CMV infection and disease.\"\nFor more news, follow Medscape on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube",

The country's minister of health announced last week that the variant had already spread in different areas of the country. \nThe next day, the World Health Organization designated Omicron a \"variant of concern.\" \nPresident Joe Biden echoed this statement at a news briefing today, but he stressed that the new variant is a \"cause for concern, not a cause for panic.\"\nCOVID-19 vaccine makers are looking into the vaccine's protection against the new variant.\n\"The mutations in the Omicron variant are concerning, and for several days, we have been moving as fast as possible to execute our strategy to address this variant,\" St\u00e9phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, said in a statement. \nPfizer says that data about its vaccine's protection against Omicron should be released in the coming weeks. \nA number of countries are making efforts to prevent the global spread of Omicron. The US is just one of a number of countries that have placed new travel restrictions on South Africa and its neighboring countries. \nSo what makes Omicron different from other COVID-19 variants? And how concerned should we be? Health experts help us break it down. \nWhat Do We Know So Far? \nThere is a lot that we don't know about Omicron, including whether it causes more severe illness than other variants, says Leana Wen, MD, MSc, an emergency doctor and public health professor at George Washington University in Washington, DC.\nBut we do know that it's a variant with an unusually high number of mutations, or changes in the virus' genetic material. \nEarly evidence also shows that the Omicron variant may spread easier than other COVID-19 variants, she says. \n\"That's very concerning because Delta, which is the dominant variant here in the US and around the world, is already extremely contagious. So, if this is even more contagious, it could displace the Delta variant,\" says Wen.\nIs the Omicron Variant in the US?\nAs of right now, no cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in the US. \nEither way, you should stay calm, says William Schaffner, MD, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\"Even if it were to be here in the United States, the dominant \u2014 the 99% that is causing disease in your community today \u2014 that strain is Delta,\" he says. \"And we know the vaccines work against Delta.\"\nWill COVID-19 Vaccines Work Against Omicron?\n\"We don't know whether the large number of mutations renders the vaccines less effective against this variant,\" says Wen. \"Although many scientists believe \u2014 especially with a booster shot \u2014 that it's not going to render the vaccines ineffective.\"",

            "Content": "Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.\nJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Monday blocked President Joe Biden's administration from enforcing a coronavirus vaccine mandate on thousands of health care workers in 10 states that had brought the first legal challenge against the requirement.\nThe court order said that the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid had no clear authority from Congress to enact the vaccine mandate for providers participating in the two government health care programs for the elderly, disabled and poor.\nThe preliminary injunction by St. Louis-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Schelp applies to a coalition of suing states that includes Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Similar lawsuits also are pending in other states.\nThe federal rule requires COVID-19 vaccinations for more than 17 million workers nationwide in about 76,000 health care facilities and home health care providers that get funding from the government health programs. Workers are to receive their first dose by Dec. 6 and their second shot by Jan. 4\nThe court order against the health care vaccine mandate comes after Biden's administration suffered a similar setback for a broader policy. A federal court previously placed a hold on a separate rule requiring businesses with more than 100 employees to ensure their workers get vaccinated or else wear masks and get tested weekly for the coronavirus.\nBiden's administration contends federal rules supersede state policies prohibiting vaccine mandates and are essential to slowing the pandemic.\nBut the judge in the health care provider case wrote that federal officials likely overstepped their legal powers.\n\"CMS seeks to overtake an area of traditional state authority by imposing an unprecedented demand to federally dictate the private medical decisions of millions of Americans. Such action challenges traditional notions of federalism,\" Schelp wrote in his order.\nEven under an exceedingly broad interpretation of federal powers, \"Congress did not clearly authorize CMS to enact the this politically and economically vast, federalism-altering, and boundary-pushing mandate,\" Schelp wrote.",

Inspectors with the Department of Building and Safety will enforce the mandate, and the city hopes to eventually get assistance from the LA County Department of Public Health, Tso said. She didn't immediately know if any warnings or citations were issued on Monday.\nLos Angeles is among a growing number of cities across the U.S., including San Francisco and New York City, requiring people show proof of vaccination to enter various types of businesses and venues. But rules in the nation's second-most-populous city, called SafePassLA, apply to more types of businesses and other indoor locations including concert halls, museums and convention centers.\nA sign reminding customers to be prepared to show their vaccine cards hangs at the Muddy Paw Coffee Shop in the Eagle Rock neighborhood, where owner Darren Laborie said he's thankful that the vast majority of his regulars have happily complied with the shifting regulations over the past year and a half.\n\"We have to adapt to whatever rules are coming at us. And our customers go along with us,\" Laborie said. Those that don't want to wear a mask or show vaccine proof can sit in the outdoor patio or take their coffees and pastries to go, he said.\nOne year ago, Los Angeles was becoming the state's epicenter of the worst spike of the pandemic in California. By January an average of 500 people were dying statewide every day.\nTo guard against another spike in cases, deaths and hospitalizations, the LA City Council voted 11-2 last month for the ordinance that requires people 12 and older to be fully vaccinated to enter indoor public spaces including sports arenas, museums, spas, indoor city facilities and other locations. Retail stores and shopping malls are exempt.\nNegative coronavirus tests within 72 hours of entry to those establishments would be required for people with religious or medical exemptions for vaccinations. Customers without proof can still use outdoor facilities and can briefly enter a business to use a restroom or pick up a food order.",

Pedersen, MD, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.\n\"This randomized controlled trial is the largest to date comparing such an early MI rule-out strategy with the current standard of care. We showed that accelerated rule-out of MI, using prehospital copeptin and the first in-hospital high-sensitivity troponin T test, significantly reduced length of stay,\" Pedersen concluded.\n\"This study provides important data on the safety of early discharge after accelerated rule-out in a large cohort of largely unselected patients with suspected MI,\" he said.\n\"Our study is the first randomized trial to evaluate a strategy where all necessary biomarker results are available to the doctor already when first attending the patient, potentially allowing for an immediate discharge,\" he added.\nHe also pointed out that since copeptin is a marker of acute endogenous stress, normal levels may also allow rule out other life-threatening conditions.\nBut outside commentators pointed out that practice is moving toward earlier use of high-sensitivity troponin to rule out MI in hospital and they questioned whether measuring copeptin as well would add much information in this situation.\nFlooding Emergency Departments\nIn his presentation, Pedersen noted that chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and patients with suspected MI are flooding emergency departments and cardiac departments worldwide. Rapid rule-out of MI is needed to reduce the burden on the healthcare systems, he explained, but present rule-out strategies are limited by the late release of cardiac troponin in MI and the frequent need for repeated troponin measurements.\nThe biomarker copeptin has been promising in the early rule-out of acute MI, being released early and in significant amounts, with levels peaking at about 2 hours after symptom onset, Pedersen reported.  \nBecause of this early release, the optimal timing for copeptin measurement is as early as possible, preferably before the patient arrives at the hospital. In contrast, troponin should be measured at a later timepoint, after arrival to the hospital, he said.\nThe purpose of the AROMI study was to evaluate the safety and efficiency of an accelerated dual-marker rule-out strategy, where prehospital copeptin is combined with in-hospital high-sensitivity troponin T.",

Blood, MD, reported these study findings in a late-breaking session at the virtual American Heart Association (AHA) 2021 Scientific Sessions.\nResearchers delivered promising interim results in 5000 patients at last year's meeting, as previously reported and published.\nPatients were identified by electronic health record (EHR) screening or primary care clinician referral. They were given home blood pressure cuffs and received phone calls from non-licensed patient \"navigators\" who provided educational information and ordered lab tests; pharmacists initiated and titrated medicines \u2014 all without in-person patient visits.\nIn the current study, at 3 months, 40% of patients in the lipid management program and 44% of patients in the hypertension management program had attained maintenance levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure; 92% of these patients were at their target levels and the rest were close.  \n\"The program effectively improves hypertension and LDL-cholesterol in high-risk patients [and] reduces the need for in-person visits and physician time,\" Blood, a research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts concluded.\nThe findings also reaffirm difficulties in maintaining patients in a long-term program, even if it's free, he added. At the same time, this remote program was equally effective in patients who were not tech savvy or English speaking.\n\"The program has the potential to expand remote healthcare delivery, increase access to care, reduce health inequities, and improve healthcare quality,\" Blood said.\nHigh Satisfaction Among Patients, Physicians\nAmong the patients who reached maintenance levels, average blood pressure dropped from 145/84 mm Hg to 135/78 mm Hg, and average LDL-C decreased from 140 mg/dL to 70 mg/dL, from baseline to 3 months.\n\"Starting a high-intensity statin will lower LDL by 50% and up-titrating and adding blood pressure medications will lower blood pressure by this amount,\" so these findings were not surprising, senior author Benjamin M.

            "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A risk score based on readily available variables from patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) accurately predicted the risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) in a modeling study.\n\"CA-AKI is an important complication and is associated with long-term mortality, mostly driven by mortality in the first 30 days after PCI,\" Dr. Roxana Mehran of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City told Reuters Health by email.\n\"We developed a very user friendly and highly embraced, well validated risk score (Mehran CIN risk score) back in 2004,\" she said. \"We knew for sure that a risk score that is almost 20 years old would need a re-calibration but took the opportunity to see if there are new risk factors that can be assessed before, as well as during, the procedure.\"\n\"I was thrilled to see that the rates of AKI after contrast media injection/PCI have decreased despite higher-risk patients with increasing PCI complexity,\" she said. \"We observed different rates depending on which definition was used for AKI, and endorse the standardization of definitions to identify those at risk who would also be at higher risk for late mortality.\"\n\"We also identified new parameters, like hyperglycemia, as an important predictor in the risk score,\" she added.\nFor the update, published in The Lancet, 14,616 patients who underwent PCI between 2012-2017 were included in the derivation cohort (mean age, 66.2; 29.2% women) and 5,606 treated from 2018-2020 were included in the validation cohort (mean age. 67; 26.4% women).\nThe primary endpoint -- CA-AKI, defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network -- occurred in 860 (4.3%) patients overall.\nModel 1 included only pre-procedural variables: clinical presentation, estimated glomerular filtration rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes, hemoglobin, basal glucose, congestive heart failure, and age.\nModel 2 also included procedural variables: contrast volume, peri-procedural bleeding, no flow or slow flow post-procedure, and complex PCI anatomy.\nCA-AKI occurrence in the derivation cohort increased gradually from the lowest to the highest of the four risk score groups in both models (2.3%-34.9% in model 1; 2.0%-38.8% in model 2).\nInclusion of procedural variables only slightly improved discrimination of the risk score (C-statistic in the derivation cohort, 0.72 for model 1 and 0.74 for model 2; in the validation cohort, 0.84 for model 1 and 0.86 for model 2).\nThe risk of death at one-year follow-up increased significantly in patients with CA-AKI (10.2% vs. 2.5%; adjusted hazard ratio 1.76), mainly due, as Dr. Mehran indicated, to excess 30-day deaths.\nThe authors state, \"Our study confirms the increased risk of (CA-AKI) in high-risk subgroups of patients, such as older people and those with congestive heart failure or impaired renal function, underlining the need for tailored preventive strategies in these patients, as well as allowing (CA-AKI) prevention measures to be abbreviated in patients at low risk.\"\nDr. Mehran said, \"We feel that the score should await external validation, despite an excellent C-statistic for the internal validation process. We are working with our colleagues to externally validate this score, and applaud those who are already working on this.\"\nDrs. Estelle Nijssen and Joachim Wildberger of Maastricht University Medial Centre in the Netherlands, coauthors of a related editorial, commented in an email to Reuters Health, \"What is intriguing is that the risk score appears to highlight the importance of the heart for risk assessment in the setting of contrast procedures, where the focus previously lay on the kidneys and contrast material. This is a major paradigm shift.\"\n\"However, it may be important for clinicians to realize that there are no firm data to either confirm or reject a causal link between contrast administration and kidney injury or adverse events,\" they said. \"Nor is there firm evidence that prophylactic strategies improve outcomes in the long term.\"\n\"On a practical level, implementation in daily clinical practice could be complicated because it might not always be clear what to do with a patient who has a high score,\" they noted. \"Extra vigilance can of course always be applied, but prophylactic strategies (mainly intravenous hydration before and/or after contrast administration) carry risk, which is especially relevant for high-score cardiac patients.\"\nSOURCE: https://bit.ly/3I6RQQO and https://bit.ly/3cOUpII The Lancet, online November 15, 2021.",

The treatment, maribavir (Livtencity), is approved for adults and children 12 years and older who weigh at least 35 kg (77 pounds).\nThere are an estimated 200,000 adult transplants every year globally. CMV, a type of herpes virus, is one of the most common infections in transplant patients, occurring in 16% to 56% of solid organ transplant recipients and 30% to 70% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, according to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, the company that manufactures Livtencity. For immunosuppressed transplant patients, CMV infection can lead to complications that include loss of the transplanted or organ or even death.\n\"Cytomegalovirus infections that are resistant or do not respond to available drugs are of even greater concern,\" John Farley, MD, MPH, the director of the Office of Infectious Diseases in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. \"Today's approval helps meet a significant unmet medical need by providing a treatment option for this patient population.\"\nLivtencity, which is taken orally, works by preventing the activity of the enzyme responsible for virus replication. The approval, announced November 23, was based on a phase 3 clinical trial that compared Livtencity with conventional antiviral treatments in the achievement of CMV DNA concentration levels below what is measurable in transplant patients with CMV infection that is refractory or treatment-resistant. After 8 weeks, of the 235 patients who received Livtencity, 56% achieved this primary endpoint, compared with 24% of the 117 patients who received conventional antiviral treatments, the press release says.\nThe most reported adverse reactions of Livtencity were taste disturbance, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue.\n\"We are grateful for the contributions of the patients and clinicians who participated in our clinical trials, as well as the dedication of our scientists and researchers,\" said Ramona Sequeira, President of the Takeda's US Business Unit and Global Portfolio Commercialization, in a statement. \"People undergoing transplants have a lengthy and complex healthcare journey; with the approval of this treatment, we're proud to offer these individuals a new oral antiviral to fight CMV infection and disease.\"\nFor more news, follow Medscape on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube",

            "Content": "An ongoing remote digital care program to manage hypertension and hypercholesterolemia delivered by non-physicians can be effective, results from the first 10,000 patients demonstrate.\nLead investigator Alexander J. Blood, MD, reported these study findings in a late-breaking session at the virtual American Heart Association (AHA) 2021 Scientific Sessions.\nResearchers delivered promising interim results in 5000 patients at last year's meeting, as previously reported and published.\nPatients were identified by electronic health record (EHR) screening or primary care clinician referral. They were given home blood pressure cuffs and received phone calls from non-licensed patient \"navigators\" who provided educational information and ordered lab tests; pharmacists initiated and titrated medicines \u2014 all without in-person patient visits.\nIn the current study, at 3 months, 40% of patients in the lipid management program and 44% of patients in the hypertension management program had attained maintenance levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure; 92% of these patients were at their target levels and the rest were close.  \n\"The program effectively improves hypertension and LDL-cholesterol in high-risk patients [and] reduces the need for in-person visits and physician time,\" Blood, a research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts concluded.\nThe findings also reaffirm difficulties in maintaining patients in a long-term program, even if it's free, he added. At the same time, this remote program was equally effective in patients who were not tech savvy or English speaking.\n\"The program has the potential to expand remote healthcare delivery, increase access to care, reduce health inequities, and improve healthcare quality,\" Blood said.\nHigh Satisfaction Among Patients, Physicians\nAmong the patients who reached maintenance levels, average blood pressure dropped from 145/84 mm Hg to 135/78 mm Hg, and average LDL-C decreased from 140 mg/dL to 70 mg/dL, from baseline to 3 months.\n\"Starting a high-intensity statin will lower LDL by 50% and up-titrating and adding blood pressure medications will lower blood pressure by this amount,\" so these findings were not surprising, senior author Benjamin M. Scirica, MD, MPH, explained to theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology in an email.\nThis study confirms that \"we have incredible therapies, mostly generic, that can substantially lower cardiovascular risk,\" said Scirica, director of quality initiatives at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Cardiovascular Division, and associate professor, Harvard School of Medicine, Boston.\n\"The challenge,\" he added, \"is the 'last mile' dilemma of all medical therapy: how do we identify, engage, motivate, and treat these patients more effectively with guideline-directed therapies?\"\nWith this program, \"we receive high patient satisfaction scores from patients and their primary care providers who are relieved to receive help in managing chronic diseases,\" he said.",

            "Content": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disturbance seen in clinical practice. A number of trials have shown that the condition, which is most prevalent among the elderly, increases the chance of cerebrovascular accidents and of blood clots forming in the heart, increasing total mortality. These aspects are well-established, as is the use of anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolism in individuals with relevant risk scores. Yet although previous research has looked at the association between atrial fibrillation and cognitive decline, no studies to date have explored the effects of oral anticoagulants on the cognitive and functional aspects of patients.\nBut a Brazilian trial that brings to light the significant effects of anticoagulants on brain health was recently presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2021.\nThe Cognitive Impairment Related to Atrial Fibrillation (GIRAF) study evaluated the effects of the anticoagulants warfarin and dabigatran on cognitive and functional impairment, bleeding occurrence, and cerebrovascular complications. It was led by cardiologist Bruno Caramelli, MD, PhD, associate professor and director of the interdisciplinary medicine in cardiology unit at the Heart Institute (InCor) of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Medicine Clinics Hospital.\n\"There was no difference between the patients in the dabigatran group and the patients in the warfarin group,\" he told Medscape Medical News.\nThe adequate use of anticoagulants can prevent cognitive decline in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation, Caramelli and his colleagues determined after 2 years of follow-up. This conclusion is based on data obtained from scales that measure memory, executive function, language, and attention. All participants completed a series of 90-minute cognitive and functional evaluations at baseline and during follow-up visits. Patients also underwent a brain MRI at baseline and after 2 years to identify possible stroke.\n\"There was no control group, as it would have been unethical to provide inadequate or incomplete treatment. That's why I can't say for certain that, if well treated, patients won't develop cognitive decline. On the other hand, using historic control data from previous studies allows us to make this inference, which, while speculative, has a good chance of being correct,\" Caramelli said.\nThe randomized, multicenter, prospective GIRAF trial evaluated 200 patients (62% male) older than 70 years with confirmed atrial fibrillation. Participants were randomly assigned to a 2-year course of dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily, or to warfarin once daily at a dose sufficient to clot the blood. Most were treated at public hospitals in Brazil's Unified Healthcare System.\nWhen designing the study, the investigators were concerned whether they would find tools sensitive enough to assess higher cognitive function.\n\"We carried out tests that analyzed various cognitive domains in order to find out what was happening. They were quite labor-intensive, and took between 90 minutes and 2 hours to complete. Perhaps this helps to explain why, in the past, many studies only used tests that were much easier and quicker, and why they neglected to incorporate this type of assessment,\" Caramelli explained.",

            "Content": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is linked to a significantly reduced risk of depression in patients with insomnia, new research shows.\nInsomnia affects over 50% of older adults, and insomnia contributes to a twofold greater risk for major depression, investigators note.\n\"We show that by treating insomnia with a simple behavioral approach called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, or CBT-I, you can reduce the likelihood of developing depression by over 50%,\" lead author Michael R. Irwin, MD, Cousins Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, Geffen School of Medicine, told Medscape Medical News.\nThe study is unique in that the treatment \"is not just reducing depression, it's preventing depression,\" Irwin added.\nThe findings were published online November 24 in JAMA Psychiatry.\nPrimary Outcome Met\nThe study included 291 patients aged 60 years and older (mean age, 70 years; 58% women) with confirmed insomnia disorder and no major depression within the previous 12 months.\nAll were randomly assigned to receive either CBT-I or Sleep Education Therapy (SET).\nCBT-I is a first-line treatment for insomnia that includes five components that include cognitive therapy targeting dysfunctional thoughts about sleep, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation.\nSET provides information on behavioral and environmental factors contributing to poor sleep. While sleep education provides tips on improving sleep, CBT-I helps patients implement those changes and behaviors, Irwin noted.\nBoth interventions were delivered by trained personnel in weekly 120-minute group sessions for 2 months, consistent with the format and duration of most CBT-I trials.\nThe primary outcome was time to incident or recurrent major depressive disorder as diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview of the DSM-5 every 6 months during 36 months of follow-up. A monthly Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was used to screen for depressive symptoms.\nResults showed depression occurred in 12.2% of the CBT-I group vs 25.9% of the SET group. The hazard ratio (HR) for depression in the CBT-I group compared with the SET group was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.29 \u2013 0.88; P = .02). The number needed to treat to prevent incident or recurrent depression was 7.3.\nAfter adjusting for factors affecting depression risk such as sex, educational level, income, comorbidity, and history of depression, the HR for depression in the CBT-I group vs the SET group was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.23 \u2013 0.86; P = .02).\nTreatment with CBT-I yielded an annual 4.1% incidence of depression, which is similar to the population rate and half the rate in SET, which was 8.6%.\n\"Remission Is Key\"\nThe secondary outcome was sustained remission of insomnia disorder. The investigators found a greater proportion of the CBT-I group than the SET group achieved remission after treatment (50.7% vs 37.7%; 95% CI, 0.10 \u2013 0.93; P = .02).",

            "Content": "Individuals diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have higher volumes of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), according to a new analysis of data from the SHIP-Trend-0 cohort in Western Pomerania, Germany, which is part of the Study of Health In Pomerania (SHIP). The association was true for individual measures of OSA, including apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI).\nWMHs are often seen on MRI in older people and in patients with stroke or dementia, and they may be an indicator of cerebral small-vessel disease. They are linked to greater risk of abnormal gait, worsening balance, depression, cognitive decline, dementia, stroke, and death. Suggested mechanisms for harms from WMHs include ischemia, hypoxia, hypoperfusion, inflammation, and demyelination.\nWMHs have been linked to vascular risk factors like smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. Brain pathology studies have found loss of myelin, axonal loss, and scarring close to WMHs.\nAlthough a few studies have looked for associations between WMHs and OSA, they have yielded inconsistent results. The new work employed highly standardized data collection and more complete covariate adjustment. The results, published in JAMA Network Open, suggest a novel, and potentially treatable, pathologic WMH mechanism, according to the authors.\n\"This is an important study. It has strong methodology. The automated analysis of WMH in a large population-based cohort helps to eliminate several biases that can occur in this type of assessment. The data analysis was massive, with adequate control of all potential confounders and testing for interactions. This generated robust results,\" said Diego Z. Carvalho, MD, who was asked to comment on the findings. Carvalho is an assistant professor of neurology at the Center for Sleep Medicine at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.\nWorse Apnea, Worse Hyperintensity\n\"The association varies according to the degree of apnea severity, so mild OSA is probably not associated with increased WMH, while severe OSA is mostly likely driving most of the associations,\" said Carvalho.\nIf a causal mechanism were to be proven, it would \"bring a stronger call for treatment of severe OSA patients, particularly those with increased risk for small-vessel disease, [such as] patients with metabolic syndrome. Likewise, patients with severe OSA would be the best candidates for therapeutic trials with CPAP with or without possible adjunctive neuroprotective treatment for halting or slowing down WMH progression,\" said Carvalho.\nStuart McCarter, MD, who is an instructor of neurology at the Center for Sleep Medicine at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, also found the results interesting but pointed out that much more work needs to be done. \"While they found a relationship between OSA as well as OSA severity and WMH despite adjusting for other known confounders, it is unlikely that it is as simple as OSA is the main causal factor for WMH, given the complex relationship between OSA, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. However, this data does highlight the importance of considering OSA in addition to other more traditional risk factors when considering modifiable risk factors for brain aging,\" said McCarter. The study cohort was mostly of White European ancestry, so more work also needs to be done in other racial groups, McCarter added.\nThe study underlines the importance of screening among individuals with cognitive impairment. \"If OSA represents a modifiable risk factor for WMH and associated cognitive decline, then it would represent one of the few potentially treatable etiologies, or at least contributors of cognitive impairment,\" said McCarter.\nThe SHIP-Trend-0 cohort is drawn from adults in Western Pomerania. The researchers analyzed data from 529 patients who had WMH and for whom intracranial volume data were available. Each member of the cohort also underwent polysomnography.\nBased on AHI criteria, 24% of the overall sample had mild OSA, 10% had moderate OSA, and 6% had severe OSA.\nAfter adjustment for sex, age, intracranial volume, and body weight, WMH volume was associated with AHI (\u03b2 = 0.024; P < .001) and ODI (\u03b2 = 0.033; P < .001). WMH counts were also associated with AHI (\u03b2 = 0.008; P = .01) and ODI (\u03b2 = 0.011; P = .02).\nThe effect size increased with greater OSA severity, as measured by AHI for both WMH volume (\u03b2 = 0.312, 0.480, and 1.255 for mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively) and WMH count (\u03b2 = 0.129, 0.107, and 0.419). The ODI regression models showed similar associations for WMH volume (\u03b2 = 0.426, 1.030, and 1.130) and WMH count (\u03b2 = 0.141, 0.315, and 0.538).\nCarvalho and McCarter have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.\nJAMA Netw Open.

The complaint was coordinated by the union Global Nurses United and Progressive International, launched last year to unite, organize, and mobilize progressive forces worldwide.\nZenei Triunfo-Cortez, RN\n\"This is tearing me up. No one is safe until everyone is safe,\" Zenei Triunfo-Cortez, RN, co-president of NNU, told Medscape Medical News. The nurses' complaint alleges that the European Union (EU) along with the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, and Singapore are preventing vaccines from getting into the arms of citizens in those countries and are favoring pharmaceutical company profits over human life.\nThe EU and offending countries, according to the complaint, have blocked a temporary waiver of corporate pharmaceutical intellectual property rights under the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the complaint states. The South African and Indian governments proposed the waiver at the WTO last year to speed up the manufacture and distribution of COVID vaccines to low- and moderate-income countries, according to the complaint. More than 45% of the world's population still has not received even one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the complaint alleges.\n\"These countries have violated our rights and the rights of our patients \u2015 and caused the loss of countless lives [through] continued opposition to the TRIPS waiver...resulting in the violation of human rights of peoples across the world,\" according to an NNU press release.\n\"COVID-19 cases continue to soar in numerous parts of the world, while pharmaceutical companies and governments have failed to ensure that critical treatments and vaccines are distributed equitably in order to respond to the pandemic,\" the nurses' unions wrote. \"High-income countries have procured upwards of 7 billion confirmed vaccine doses, while low-income countries have only been able to procure approximately 300 million doses. This has created what public health advocates around the world have described as 'vaccine apartheid.' \"\nCortez said of the lower-income countries, \"We have been sending them vaccines. They should not rely on charity. They should be able to manufacturer their own vaccines.\"\nThe nurses' complaint addressed Tlaleng Mofokeng, MBChB, a physician and the UN's Special Rapporteur on Physical and Mental Health, calling on her to lead an investigation into the nurses' alleged human rights violations. The WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva at which the issue could have been discussed this week was postponed because of the Omicron variant.\n\"We are hoping whenever they reconvene, the committee will act on this under the leadership of Dr Mofokeng,\" Cortez said.\nMofokeng supported the nurses' position, according to the release. \"The nurses' core demand is one I share: States have a collective responsibility to use all available means to facilitate faster access to vaccines, including by introducing a temporary waiver of relevant intellectual property rights under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement),\" she said. \"Nurses and health care workers have been on the front line keeping us safe and have witnessed the most painful and heart-wrenching effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Their evident commitment to the right to physical and mental health provides them with moral authority.\"\nUS President Joe Biden endorsed the waiver in May, but the coordinated campaign by the nurses' unions may be able to convince the UN to take the effort to the next level, Cortez said. \"Hopefully we will create a louder voice and have a much bigger impact\" and persuade the UN committee that it \"should be looking out for the welfare of the world.\"\nFor more news, follow Medscape on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.",

The country's minister of health announced last week that the variant had already spread in different areas of the country. \nThe next day, the World Health Organization designated Omicron a \"variant of concern.\" \nPresident Joe Biden echoed this statement at a news briefing today, but he stressed that the new variant is a \"cause for concern, not a cause for panic.\"\nCOVID-19 vaccine makers are looking into the vaccine's protection against the new variant.\n\"The mutations in the Omicron variant are concerning, and for several days, we have been moving as fast as possible to execute our strategy to address this variant,\" St\u00e9phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, said in a statement. \nPfizer says that data about its vaccine's protection against Omicron should be released in the coming weeks. \nA number of countries are making efforts to prevent the global spread of Omicron. The US is just one of a number of countries that have placed new travel restrictions on South Africa and its neighboring countries. \nSo what makes Omicron different from other COVID-19 variants? And how concerned should we be? Health experts help us break it down. \nWhat Do We Know So Far? \nThere is a lot that we don't know about Omicron, including whether it causes more severe illness than other variants, says Leana Wen, MD, MSc, an emergency doctor and public health professor at George Washington University in Washington, DC.\nBut we do know that it's a variant with an unusually high number of mutations, or changes in the virus' genetic material. \nEarly evidence also shows that the Omicron variant may spread easier than other COVID-19 variants, she says. \n\"That's very concerning because Delta, which is the dominant variant here in the US and around the world, is already extremely contagious. So, if this is even more contagious, it could displace the Delta variant,\" says Wen.\nIs the Omicron Variant in the US?\nAs of right now, no cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in the US. \nEither way, you should stay calm, says William Schaffner, MD, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\"Even if it were to be here in the United States, the dominant \u2014 the 99% that is causing disease in your community today \u2014 that strain is Delta,\" he says. \"And we know the vaccines work against Delta.\"\nWill COVID-19 Vaccines Work Against Omicron?\n\"We don't know whether the large number of mutations renders the vaccines less effective against this variant,\" says Wen. \"Although many scientists believe \u2014 especially with a booster shot \u2014 that it's not going to render the vaccines ineffective.\"",

The organization estimates that there will be more than 21,000 new cases and more than 13,000 deaths in 2021.\nCurrently, surgeons use preoperative imaging as well as visual inspection of tumors under normal light and examination by touch to identify ovarian cancer lesions.\nPafolacianine offers a new tool to enhance surgeons' ability \"to identify deadly ovarian tumors that may otherwise go undetected,\" Alex Gorovets, MD, deputy director of the Office of Specialty Medicine in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a press statement.\nOvarian cancer often causes the body to overproduce the folate receptor protein in cell membranes. Pafolacianine, employed with a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system cleared by the FDA for use alongside the drug, binds to and illuminates these proteins under fluorescent light, \"boosting surgeons' ability to identify the cancerous tissue,\" the agency in a statement.\nThe safety and effectiveness of pafolacianine was evaluated in a randomized, multi-center, open-label study of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer or with high clinical suspicion of ovarian cancer. Of the 134 women undergoing surgery who received a dose of pafolacianine and were evaluated under both normal and fluorescent light, 26.9% had at least one cancerous lesion detected that was not observed by standard visual or tactile inspection.\nThe most common side effects of pafolacianine were infusion-related reactions, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, chest discomfort, itching, and hypersensitivity.\nPafolacianine may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The use of folate, folic acid, or folate-containing supplements should be avoided within 48 hours before administration of pafolacianine. \nThe FDA also cautioned about the possible risk of image interpretation errors, including false negatives and false positives, with the use of the new drug and near-infrared fluorescence imaging system.\nThe FDA previously granted pafolacianine orphan-drug, priority, and fast track designations.\nFor more from Medscape Oncology, join us on  Twitter  and  Facebook",

Fifteen percent of health system and health insurer CEOs are women, according to the study, which was published online today in JAMA Network Open. Representation by women as chairpersons of the board of directors at health systems and health insurers was just slightly better: 17.5% of chairpersons at health systems are women, and 21.3% of boards of directors have chairpersons who are women.\nThe study also found that having a woman as a health system CEO was associated with a higher proportion of women on the board of directors or in roles as senior executives.

            "Content": "Key takeaways\nPalliative care for inoperable biliary tract cancer (BTC) reduces the use of aggressive chemotherapy at the end of life as well as the risk of death in the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU).\nEarlier referral to palliative care, however, does not improve overall survival.\nStill, referrals to palliative care should not wait until systemic therapies have been exhausted.\nWhy This Matters\nMost BTC patients present too late for curative surgery.\nReferrals to palliative care usually come only after active treatments are exhausted.\nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends that palliative care occur alongside active treatment.\nThe recent findings from researchers based in France support this recommendation.\nStudy Design\nThe study included 200 patients with locally advanced or metastatic BTC treated from 2013 to 2019 at six hospitals in eastern France.\nThe median age of the patients was 67.6 years, 61% were men, and 188 died (94%).\nKey Results\nOf the 200 patients included in the review, 44% received no palliative care,15% had palliative care within 3 months of their diagnosis, 10% had palliative care 3 to 6 months after diagnosis, and 32% had palliative care 6 months or more after.\nThirty-seven percent of patients in the no palliative care group had \"useless\" chemotherapy in their last month vs 10% to 30% of patients receiving palliative care.\nSeventy-two percent of the no palliative care group died in the ICU and 8% died in the ED, vs 21% and 0%, respectively, of patients receiving palliative care.\nPatients in the palliative care group were more likely to die in a palliative care unit.\nContrary to previous reports, earlier referrals to palliative care did not improve survival.\nLimitations\nIt was a retrospective study with no randomization.\nSurvival outcomes were confounded because the hospitals generally waited until patients were close to death before referring to palliative care.\nDisclosures\nThere was no funding for the work and the investigators did not report any conflicts of interest.\nThis is a summary of a preprint research report led by Margaux Miralles of the University Hospital Centre Nancy, provided to you by Medscape.

            "Content": "The US Food and Drug Administration has approved pafolacianine (Cytalux), an imaging drug indicated for use in adult patients with ovarian cancer undergoing surgery.\nThe new drug \"is designed to improve the ability to locate additional ovarian cancerous tissue that is normally difficult to detect during surgery,\" according to the agency.\nPafolacianine, administered via intravenous injection prior to surgery, is the first FDA-approved tumor-targeted fluorescent agent for ovarian cancer.\nIn a press statement, drug inventor Philip Low, PhD, of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, said the agent causes ovarian cancer lesions to \"light up like stars against a night sky.\"\nImproving detection of ovarian cancer lesions is critical given that ovarian cancer is one of the \"deadliest of all female reproductive system cancers,\" according to the American Cancer Society. The organization estimates that there will be more than 21,000 new cases and more than 13,000 deaths in 2021.\nCurrently, surgeons use preoperative imaging as well as visual inspection of tumors under normal light and examination by touch to identify ovarian cancer lesions.\nPafolacianine offers a new tool to enhance surgeons' ability \"to identify deadly ovarian tumors that may otherwise go undetected,\" Alex Gorovets, MD, deputy director of the Office of Specialty Medicine in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a press statement.\nOvarian cancer often causes the body to overproduce the folate receptor protein in cell membranes. Pafolacianine, employed with a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system cleared by the FDA for use alongside the drug, binds to and illuminates these proteins under fluorescent light, \"boosting surgeons' ability to identify the cancerous tissue,\" the agency in a statement.\nThe safety and effectiveness of pafolacianine was evaluated in a randomized, multi-center, open-label study of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer or with high clinical suspicion of ovarian cancer. Of the 134 women undergoing surgery who received a dose of pafolacianine and were evaluated under both normal and fluorescent light, 26.9% had at least one cancerous lesion detected that was not observed by standard visual or tactile inspection.\nThe most common side effects of pafolacianine were infusion-related reactions, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, chest discomfort, itching, and hypersensitivity.\nPafolacianine may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The use of folate, folic acid, or folate-containing supplements should be avoided within 48 hours before administration of pafolacianine. \nThe FDA also cautioned about the possible risk of image interpretation errors, including false negatives and false positives, with the use of the new drug and near-infrared fluorescence imaging system.\nThe FDA previously granted pafolacianine orphan-drug, priority, and fast track designations.\nFor more from Medscape Oncology, join us on  Twitter  and  Facebook",

            "Content": "The Oncology Care Model (OCM) led to modest savings per episode of care but, when factoring in monthly and performance-based payments, resulted in an overall loss of more than $315 million to Medicare, according to one of the most thorough studies of the program.\nThe analysis, published on November 9 in JAMA, found that per episode savings of $297 during the first 3 years of the model's implementation were offset by $704 in payments for enhanced services to 201 participating practices. When considering the $160 monthly and performance-based payments, the authors estimated a net loss of $315.6 million between 2016 and 2019. In addition, the researchers found no significant differences in the use of most services, quality, or patient experience.\n\"[The OCM] hasn't reached the hoped-for results \u2015 savings with stable or improved quality \u2015 that would allow CMS [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services] to expand it nationally,\" Nancy Keating, MD, MPH, professor of health care policy and medicine in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, Boston, and lead author of the recent JAMA study, told Medscape Medical News. \"That means CMS needs to take what they learned from OCM and develop and test new models.\"\nThe OCM represents the largest alternative payment model, rolled out by CMS in 2016 to address value-based payment for cancer care. More than 3200 oncologists and 201 physician practices voluntarily entered the program, which includes financial and performance accountability for 6-month episodes of care for beneficiaries with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.\nSince its implementation, studies assessing the success of the program have yielded mixed results.\nA 2018 analysis, for instance, found that one large community practice saved Medicare $3 million over a year after adopting the OCM.\nBut a study published earlier this year found that while community practices experienced lower drug costs in lung and prostate cancer and lower office-based costs after implementing the program, the difference was not statistically significant when accounting for all costs.\nAnother recent study found cost reductions for all cancers, but again those savings were offset by administrative expenses. In this study, the OCM led to a $155 million net loss to Medicare over 4 years.\nInside the New Analysis\nIn the latest study, Keating and colleagues evaluated the association of the OCM with changes in Medicare spending, utilization, quality, and patient experience during the first 3 years after implementation.\nUsing claims for Medicare Parts A, B, and D, the researchers looked at utilization and payments for hospitalizations, emergency and office visits, chemotherapy, supportive care, and imaging as well as quality measures \u2014 such as chemotherapy-associated hospitalizations, emergency visits, end-of-life care, and survival \u2014 and patient experience. The study included 987,332 episodes among the 201 OCM practices and 1,122,597 episodes from 534 practices not participating in the program.",

            "Content": "For the first time, a product is available specifically for use in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumors.\nThe product is an intravenous formulation of nanoparticle albumin-bound nab-sirolimus (Fyarro) from Aadi Biosciences. The company announced on November 23 that the drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nAlthough sirolimus and other oral mTOR inhibitors are used off label for the condition, Fyarro is the first medication to be approved specifically for the rare tumor, a form of soft tissue sarcoma that the company estimates strikes about 100\u2013300 people in the US annually, predominantly women.\nThe company anticipates its new formulation \"will become a standard of care\" for the condition.\nAadi is planning a first quarter 2022 launch. The wholesale acquisition cost for a month of treatment will be approximately $39,000, a company executive said on an investors call.\nIn the new formulation, the goal of binding sirolimus to albumin is to deliver higher concentrations of the drug to the tumor with less toxicity. Aadi founder and CEO Neil Desai, PhD, helped invent nab technology and was a driver behind its first clinical application, nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane).\nThe product was approved on the basis of results from an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial in 34 patients, 31 of whom were evaluable for efficacy. These patients had not been previously treated with an mTOR inhibitor.\nThe trial, dubbed AMPECT, was the first prospective study in malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (mPEComas).\nThe overall response rate was 39%; all 12 responses were partial at first, but two converted to complete responses, one after 11 months of treatment and the other after 34 months.\nMedian progression-free survival was 10.6 months and median overall survival 40.8 months. Median duration of response was not reached after a median follow-up of 36 months.\nBy way of comparison, a recent series of 40 malignant PEComa patients treated with oral mTOR inhibitors \u2015 most often sirolimus \u2015 reported a response rate of 40% and median progression-free survival of 9 months.\nAMPECT investigators said their study \"provides evidence that nab-sirolimus may offer an important benefit\" over oral alternatives.\nThere's been no direct clinical comparison but nab-sirolimus \"has a distinct pharmacologic profile and pharmacokinetics\" with \"significantly higher tumor growth inhibition, higher intratumoral drug accumulation, and greater mTOR target suppression,\" said the study team, led by Andrew Wagner, MD, PhD, an oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston.\nThere were no drug-related grade 4 adverse events or deaths in AMPECT, and no new mTOR inhibitor safety signals.\nMore than half of patients developed stomatitis, infections, fatigue, and rash. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities that occurred in more than 10% included lymphocytopenia, increased glucose, and decreased potassium. There was one instance each of grade 3 acute kidney injury, acute coronary syndrome, edema, and pancytopenia.\nAbout a third of patients required dose reductions. Three patients stopped treatment entirely because of anemia, noninfectious cystitis, and pneumonitis.\nTSC2 mutations related to mTOR pathway overactivation \u2015 a driver of malignant PEComa \u2015 were a strong predictor of response in AMPECT, while the absence of pS6 mutations, which reflects a lack of activation, strongly predicted negative response.\nThe median age of the study participants was 60 years, and over 80% of the patients were women. Primary tumors were most often in the uterus, pelvis, or retroperitoneum. The lungs were the most common site of metastases.\nDosing in the trial was 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, which is the approved dosing. Median time to nab-sirolimus response was 1.4 months.\nAMPECT was funded by Aadi Bioscience. Wagner reported research funding from the company. Several authors are employees with stock in Aadi, including Desai, who also holds patents on the technology. Other authors reported research funding and/or being a consultant for the company.\nM.

            "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new study adds to growing evidence that use of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) is associated with an increased risk of certain retinal disorders, researchers say.\nPPS is commonly prescribed to relieve bladder pain and discomfort due to interstitial cystitis.\n\"This study was an attempt to replicate the results of existing studies which, admittedly, have been very consistent.\" Dr. Gerald McGwin of the University of Alabama at Birmingham told Reuters Health by email. \"Despite the consistency of the research to date, there remain some unresolved epidemiologic issues, including the relevant dose and duration of exposure, the impact on visual function and whether any visual changes are reversible with cessation of the medication.\"\n\"Also, the FAERS (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System) is a unique resource which has only rarely been used in ophthalmology, so we also viewed the study as an opportunity to highlight FAERS,\" he noted.\n\"The current drug label warns users about the potential visual side effects,\" he said. \"However, it would be advisable for clinicians to highlight this side effect to their patients, specifically of the early signs of the potentially irreversible retinal damage/injury.\"\n\"As with many epidemiologic studies, the focus is often on the RELATIVE risk of an outcome or side effect,\" he added. \"In this case, while the relative risk is high, the ABSOLUTE risk is quite low. Therefore, the well-established beneficial effects of this drug should be weighed against the rarity of this specific side effect.\"\nAs reported in JAMA Ophthalmology, Dr. McGwin and colleagues conducted a disproportionality analysis using the FAERS from 2013-2020, comparing adverse event reports associated with various drugs taken for interstitial cystitis, cystitis, bladder disorder, or bladder pain.\nThe main outcome was retinal adverse events, including conditions associated with retinal damage attributable to blockage of its blood supply, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, and diseases affecting the retina.\nA total of 2,775 reports were included in the PPS group (70.9% for women) and 6,833 in the other drugs group (59.1% for women).\nThe proportion of adverse events for any macular event relative to all other events was higher for PPS users compared with those using other interstitial cystitis and bladder pain drugs (proportionate reporting ratio, 1.21).\nSpecific retinal conditions that were proportionately more common among PPS users included: macular degeneration (0.8% of users vs. 0.2%); maculopathy (3.4%] vs. 0.03%); retinal dystrophy (0.1% vs. 0), retinal injury (0.2% vs. 0), and retinal toxicity (0.1% vs. 0).\nSumming up, the authors state, \"The results of the current study add to the growing evidence that PPS use is associated with an increased risk of maculopathy. Studies that rule out prevalent retinal abnormalities prior to the initiation of PPS would strengthen the current body of literature.\"\nDr. Nimesh Patel, an ophthalmologist in the Retina Service at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston commented in an email to Reuters Health, \"I am in agreement with the findings. I have found retinal damage associated with PPS use in patients that were previously suspected to have age-related macular degeneration.\"\n\"All patients taking the medication should be made aware of the possible and not infrequent retinal damage that is caused by this medication,\" he said. \"It would be reasonable to consider a referral to an eye doctor to look for signs of toxicity if there are any visual concerns.\"\n\"This is a relatively new discovery and ongoing study is required to assess the long-term effects of the medication,\" he added. \"It is unclear if the retinal damage can progress despite the cessation of the offending agent.\"\nSOURCE: https://bit.ly/2Zr0MPk JAMA Ophthalmology, online November 18, 2021.",

She also jumped on the cookie-cutter thread.\n\"It just kind of resonated with me,\" Merrill said of the liver-and-pancreas cookie cutter. She was impressed by the accuracy of the rendition: \"I mean, it doesn't have the blood vessels and it only had one pancreatic duct there; you know, there are usually two at least. So it's not 100% accurate. But it was pretty accurate. I felt like the bile ducts were pretty good.\"\nBakerlogy owner Louise Alan said they've been doing medical designs since 2015. They are trickier than the company's other products. \"Too much detail will make the design look too cluttered and yet it needs just enough detail for an accurate depiction,\" Alan said, adding that the anatomical heart was particularly popular.\n Merrill was impressed by the range of organs available but wasn't sure she'd like to chow down on some of the creations: \"There were a lot there I definitely wouldn't want to eat\u2026like sperm cookies.\"\n However, Merrill said, \"It's nice to bring some joy and a little bit of levity to what we do and the cookie cutters do that, and allow us to\u2026joke around a little bit since we're mostly dealing with very serious and emotional things.\"\nMckay agreed. When you reach for a pancreas cookie covered in sprinkles, she said: \"It not about the stress of [surgery]; it makes everyone normal people again, just having a coffee with each other.\"\nFor more news, follow Medscape on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn",

The study also found that these numbers had barely budged in a decade. Citing an article in Ophthalmology that she co-authored, Kristen Nwanyanwu, MD, MBA, said that university ophthalmology departments are the third least diverse among all US medical specialties.\nDr Angela Elam\n\"The numbers you have shown are dismal, just dismal,\" said panelist Terri L. Young, MD, MBA, the chair of the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. \"Folks are getting different compensation schedules.

            "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In a large cohort of women with advanced breast cancer, about 40% of fractures were cancer-related, researchers say.\nBreast cancer is associated with an increased fracture risk \"attributed in part to estrogen deficiency, aromatase inhibitors, frailty, and skeletal metastases,\" Dr. Joan Lo of Kaiser Permanente Northern California in Oakland and colleagues write in JAMA Network Open.\nHowever, Dr. Lo told Reuters Health by email, the team's previous work \"suggested that to accurately assess risk and risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures, we needed to separate fractures which were pathologic -- meaning caused by the cancer -- and fractures which were not.\"\nDr. Lo and colleagues analyzed data from 5,010 women on endocrine therapy in Kaiser Permanente's Pathways cohort. The women were followed for up to 10 years after an invasive breast cancer diagnosis for incident fracture. The mean age was 60; 91% were stage I/II at initial diagnosis; 73% were non-Hispanic white; 10.8%, Asian; 9.4%, Hispanic, 4.9%, Black; and 1.6%, other or unknown ethnicity.\nThree hundred and forty women (6.8%) had incident fracture(s) during follow-up at a median of 6.7 years: 46 hip, 104 vertebral, 78 humerus, and 137 wrist. These excluded prevalent fractures, which accounted for 46 of 150 (30.7%) vertebral fractures.\nAmong women with hip fracture, 43.5% were age 80 or older, versus less than 25% for women with vertebral (22.1%), humerus (19.2%), or wrist fracture (15.3%).\nRoughly 21% of incident vertebral fractures were pathologic, as were 8.7% of incident hip fractures; the latter is consistent with the 10% reported in a 2014 publication.\nBy contrast, 99.3% of incident wrist fractures were nonpathologic, as 96.2% of humerus fractures.\nBy tumor stage, 17.2% of vertebral fractures among women with initial stage I/II disease were pathologic, versus 41.2% among women with initial stage III/IV.\nDr. Shipra Gandhi, a medical oncologist at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York, commented on the study in an email to Reuters Health. \"The study has some important implications,\" Dr. Ghandi said. \"Differentiating between pathologic and non-pathologic fractures is important for management decisions, as pathologic fractures may benefit from radiation treatment. The study highlights that clinicians should have a low threshold to consider incident vertebral fractures as pathologic in nature, especially for patients with higher-risk breast cancer.\"\n\"Future research should focus on including risk factors to develop a prediction model for development of pathologic fractures so that aggressive osteoporotic fracture prevention care - including use of bisphosphonates, radiation therapy, etc. - could be instituted early on,\" she said.\n\"Another question for future exploration,\" she added, \"is whether use of more frequent serial DEXA scans, especially for stage III or IV patients, help in risk stratifying to identify those who would benefit from aggressive interventions early.\"\nSOURCE: https://bit.ly/3DVG5tO JAMA Network Open, online November 17, 2021.",

            "Content": "A new study on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the healthcare leadership structure of organizations in the United States has found that women are underrepresented, despite making up a majority of the overall healthcare workforce. Fifteen percent of health system and health insurer CEOs are women, according to the study, which was published online today in JAMA Network Open. Representation by women as chairpersons of the board of directors at health systems and health insurers was just slightly better: 17.5% of chairpersons at health systems are women, and 21.3% of boards of directors have chairpersons who are women.\nThe study also found that having a woman as a health system CEO was associated with a higher proportion of women on the board of directors or in roles as senior executives. Having more women in senior leadership roles at health insurance companies was also associated with increased representation of women as CEOs, per the study.\nResearchers also learned that more than half (58.1%) of the leadership positions in the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are held by women.\nBismarck Odei, MD, lead author of the study, told Medscape Medical News that he was most surprised that \"the healthcare system in one of the largest populated countries in the world, where women form a slight majority, has so few women leaders influencing the day-to-day healthcare realities of women.\"\nStill, he points to the gender diversity of healthcare organizations' boards of directors as \"not a trivial statistic.\"\n\"It may be one of the more important parameters that can increase the representation of women in the CEO position across healthcare organizations,\" said Odei, a radiation oncology resident at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.\nHealthcare Organizations Are More Diverse Than Fortune 500\nAs a benchmark, women are more likely to serve as CEO at healthcare organizations than at Fortune 500 companies. Fortune reported in June that only 8.1% of these companies are led by women CEOs. Barron's reported in July that 29% of US board directors were women in 2020, which is up from 19% in 2014.\nIn addition, a 2019 analysis by consulting firm McKinsey revealed that organizations in the top quartile in terms of gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to deliver above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile.\nThe JAMA study authors wrote that the underrepresentation of women on leadership teams, especially since women make up slightly more than half (50.8%) of the US population, \"likely diminishes their role in policy decisions that affect population and women's health.\"\nPutting the study in the larger context of research in this area, Odei observes that increased diversity improves organizational performance. \"The US healthcare system has been valiantly trying to reach its full potential for some time now, and strengthening its leadership ranks with diverse and innovative voices will be key to achieving its goals.\"",

            "Content": "Short-acting opioids may complement methadone and buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal symptoms in U.S. hospitals, say authors of an opinion piece calling for rethinking current strategies for opioid withdrawal in this country.\nThe commentary by Robert A. Kleinman, MD, with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and department of psychiatry, University of Toronto, and Sarah E. Wakeman, MD, with the division of general internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, was published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\nCurrently, short-acting opioids are not recommended in the United States for opioid withdrawal symptoms (OWS) management in the hospital, the authors wrote. Instead, withdrawal symptoms are typically treated, followed by methadone or buprenorphine or nonopioid medications, but many patients don't get enough relief. Undertreated withdrawal can result in patients leaving the hospital against medical advice, which is linked with higher risk of death.\nAddiction specialist Elisabeth Poorman, MD, of the University of Illinois Chicago, said in an interview that she agrees it's time to start shifting the thinking on using short-acting opioids for OWS in hospitals. Use varies greatly by hospital and by clinician, she said.\n\"It's time to let evidence guide us and to be flexible,\" Poorman said.\nThe commentary authors noted that with methadone, patients must wait several hours for maximal symptom reduction, and the full benefits of methadone treatment are not realized until days after initiation.\nRapid initiation of methadone may be feasible in hospitals and has been proposed as an option, but further study is necessary before widespread use, the authors wrote.\nShort-Acting Opioids May Address Limitations of Other Opioids\nLofexidine, an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically for OWS.\n\"However,\" the authors said, \"more than half of patients with OWS treated with lofexidine in phase 3 efficacy trials dropped out by day five. Clonidine, another alpha-2-agonist used off label to treat OWS, has similar effects to those of lofexidine. \"\nTherefore, short-acting opioids may complement methadone and buprenorphine in treating OWS in the hospital by addressing their limitations, the authors wrote.\nKleinman and Wakeman also say short-acting opioids may help with starting buprenorphine for patients exposed to fentanyl, because short-acting opioids can relieve withdrawal symptoms while fentanyl is metabolized and excreted.\nSupplementation with short-acting opioids within the hospital can relieve withdrawal symptoms and help keep patients comfortable while methadone is titrated to more effective doses for long-term treatment, they wrote.\nWith short-acting opioids, patients may become more engaged in their care with, for example, a tamper-proof, patient-controlled analgesia pump, which would allow them to have more autonomy in administration of opioids to relieve pain and withdrawal symptoms, the authors wrote.",

There have been several clinical trials of the treatment in knee osteoarthritis, but the current study's authors said these were limited by factors such as a lack of blinding and were at high risk of bias. \"That was the impetus to do a large, high-quality study and to look at joint structure,\" Bennell said.\nStudy Details\nFor the study, which was published November 23 in JAMA, the researchers enrolled 288 adults older than 50 with knee osteoarthritis who had experienced knee pain on most days of the past month and had radiographic evidence of mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the tibiofemoral joint.\nAfter having stopped all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and pain-relief drugs 2 weeks prior \u2015 except acetaminophen \u2015 participants were randomly assigned to receive three weekly intra-articular knee injections of either a commercially available leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma or saline placebo. They were then followed for 12 months.\nAmong the 288 participants in the study, researchers saw no statistically significant difference in the change in pain scores between the treatment and placebo groups at 12 months, although there was a nonsignificantly greater reduction in pain scores among those given platelet-rich plasma. The study also found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the change in medial tibial cartilage volume.\nThe researchers also looked at a large number of secondary outcomes, including the effects of treatment on pain and function at 2 months, change in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) scores, and change in quality-of-life scores. There were no indications of any benefits from the treatment at the 2-month follow-up, and at 12 months, the study showed no significant improvements in knee pain while walking or in pain scores, KOOS scores, or quality-of-life measures.\nHowever, significantly more participants in the treatment group than in the placebo group reported overall improvement at the 2-month point \u2015 48.2% of those in the treatment arm compared with 36.2% of the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05 \u2013 1.80; P = .02). At 12 months, 42.8% of those who received platelet-rich plasma reported improved function, compared with 32.1% of those in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00 \u2013 1.86, P = .05).",

The gas also killed the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces.\n\"By combining cold plasma gas with acetyl donor molecules to improve its oxidation action, we found [the formulation] completely killed bacteria that are found in chronic wounds,\" lead author Endre J. Szili said in a press statement on the research, published in Applied Physics Letters.\n\"We investigated whether this same technology could be effective at killing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it appears that it is,\" said Szili, a senior research fellow and head of the Plasma Medicine Research Group at the Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Adelaide.\n\"To the best of knowledge our study is the first report on the use of plasma in combination with acetyl donor molecules,\" the authors note.\nCold plasma is a low-temperature, electrically generated, partially ionized glow-discharge that is tolerable to human tissue. Although the plasma gas can kill bacteria, the treatment can lose effectiveness against notoriously resistant biofilms.\nTo try to improve its efficacy in killing bacteria, Szili and colleagues combined the cold plasma with acetyl donor molecules and found the combination generated hydrogen peroxide and released peracetic acid, enhancing the ability to destroy resistant bacteria through a multipronged action.\n\"The combination of the cold plasma with acetyl donors produces additional oxidants that are less affected by the bacteria's antioxidant defense mechanisms,\" Szili explained to Medscape Medical News.\nThe formulation's synergistic effect \"can be used to target a broad spectrum of microbes and infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses,\" he added.\nGas Killed Bacteria in Foot Ulcers, COVID-19 Virus\nFor the study, the authors tested the strategy in lab experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responsible for infections in the blood, lungs, and other areas after surgery, and Staphylococcus aureus, linked to potentially life-threatening blood poisoning and pneumonia.\nThey found that, while the use of cold plasma alone was effective against P. aeruginosa, it had minimal effect on S. aureus. However, the combination treatment showed successful eradication of both types of bacteria.\n\"This is very significant for diabetic patients who have foot ulcers that are hard to heal,\" Szili said in the press statement.\nSimilar trends were observed when the virucidal activities of the formulation were tested against SARS-CoV-2.\nThe experiments showed that the plasma-activated blend effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load by 50%-84%, raising the possibility of its use in disinfecting surfaces such in hospitals or air-conditioning systems.",

Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said the state won't be \"defenseless\" if everyone wears masks indoors, gets vaccinated, gets tested, washes their hands and stays home when sick.\n\"Mark my words, we're going to see a surge in the next five days,\" Hochul said.\nAnd Dr. Dave Chokshi, the commissioner, said he is \"strongly recommending\" that all New Yorkers wear masks \"at all times when indoors and in a public setting like at your grocery or in a building lobby, offices and retail stores.\"\nThe guidance was in line with the recommendation issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in July that even vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where the virus is surging.\nMuch is still not known about the omicron variant, which was identified last week by researchers in South Africa, including whether it is more contagious than other coronavirus variants, or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.\nCases of the omicron variant have been found in countries including Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, but no cases have yet been detected in the United States.\nMayor Bill de Blasio said that while there have been no cases of the omicron variant reported in New York City, \"it is very likely there will be.\"\nChokshi, who joined de Blasio at a virtual news briefing, said the delta variant of the virus accounts for 98% of the coronavirus samples from New York City that are being sequenced now.\nHochul said she wasn't ready to announce any new sweeping COVID-19 protocols, like restrictions on visits at nursing homes.\nShe said she supports recent announcements by Erie County officials, who have warned that the county could start requiring vaccine mandates for indoor dining if rates keep surging.\nVaccination rates are increasing overall in New York, fueled in part by a mandate for health care workers to get vaccinated. New York City has also required vaccinations for city workers and for indoor dining, for example.\nBut vaccination rates are lower in western New York, the Finger Lakes and other rural communities north of New York City and its surrounding suburbs: as low as 40% in Allegany County, 47% in Wyoming County, and 49% in Yates and Seneca counties.",

            "Content": "Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.\nMerck's antiviral pill for COVID-19, molnupiravir, appears to be far less effective than early results from the clinical trial first suggested.\nAccording to an analysis by scientists at the FDA, the experimental pill cut the risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 by about 30%, compared to a placebo, and the pill showed no benefit for people with antibodies against COVID-19 from prior infection.\nThe updated analysis showed 48 hospitalizations or deaths among study participants who were randomly assigned to take the antiviral drug, compared to 68 among those who took a placebo.\nThose results come from the full set of 1,433 patients who were randomized in the clinical trial, which just became available last week.\nInitial results from the first 775 patients enrolled in the clinical trial, which were issued in a company news release in October, had said the drug cut the risk of hospitalization or death for patients at high risk of severe disease by about 50%.\nMerck has been producing millions of doses of molnupiravir, which is the first antiviral pill to treat COVID-19 infections. The United Kingdom's drug regulator authorized use of the medication in early November. The company said it expected to distribute the medication globally by the end of 2021.\nLast month, two Indian drug companies halted late-stage clinical trials of a generic version of molnupiravir after the studies failed to find any benefit to patients with moderate COVID-19. Trials in patients with milder symptoms are still ongoing.\nOn Saturday, The New England Journal of Medicine postponed its planned early release of the molnupiravir study results, citing \"new information.\"\nThe medication is designed to be given as four pills taken every 12 hours for 5 days. It's most effective when taken within the first few days of new symptoms, something that requires convenient and affordable testing.\nThe new results seem to put molnupiravir far below the effectiveness of existing treatments.\nThe infused monoclonal antibody cocktail REGEN-COV, which the FDA has already authorized for emergency use, is about 85% effective at preventing hospitalization or death in patients who are at risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, and it appears to be just as effective in people who already have antibodies against COVID-19, which is why it is being given to both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, the FDA said.\nIn early November, Pfizer said its experimental antiviral pill Paxlovid cut the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%.\nIn briefing documents posted ahead of an advisory committee meeting on Tuesday, the FDA highlights other potential safety issues with the Merck drug, which works by causing the virus to make mistakes as it copies itself, eventually causing the virus to mutate itself to death.\nThe agency has asked the advisory committee to weigh in on the right patient population for the drug: Should pregnant women get it? Could the drug harm a developing fetus?\nShould vaccinated people with breakthrough infections get it? Would it work for them? People with reduced immune function are more likely to get a breakthrough infection. They're also more likely to shed virus for a longer period of time, making them perfect incubators for variants. What could happen if we give this type of patient a drug that increases mutations?\nAnd what about mutations caused by the medication? Could they increase the potential for more variants? The agency concluded the risk of this happening was low.\nIn animal studies, the drug impacted bone formation. For this reason, the agency has agreed with the drug company that molnupiravir should not be given to anyone under the age of 18.\nAside from these concerns, the FDA says there were no major safety issues among people who took part in the clinical trial, though they acknowledge that number is small.\nSources\nFDA: \"Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting,\" Nov. 30, 2021.\nNews releases, Merck, Oct. 1, 2021 and Nov. 26, 2021.",

The gas also killed the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces.\n\"By combining cold plasma gas with acetyl donor molecules to improve its oxidation action, we found [the formulation] completely killed bacteria that are found in chronic wounds,\" lead author Endre J. Szili said in a press statement on the research, published in Applied Physics Letters.\n\"We investigated whether this same technology could be effective at killing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it appears that it is,\" said Szili, a senior research fellow and head of the Plasma Medicine Research Group at the Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Adelaide.\n\"To the best of knowledge our study is the first report on the use of plasma in combination with acetyl donor molecules,\" the authors note.\nCold plasma is a low-temperature, electrically generated, partially ionized glow-discharge that is tolerable to human tissue. Although the plasma gas can kill bacteria, the treatment can lose effectiveness against notoriously resistant biofilms.\nTo try to improve its efficacy in killing bacteria, Szili and colleagues combined the cold plasma with acetyl donor molecules and found the combination generated hydrogen peroxide and released peracetic acid, enhancing the ability to destroy resistant bacteria through a multipronged action.\n\"The combination of the cold plasma with acetyl donors produces additional oxidants that are less affected by the bacteria's antioxidant defense mechanisms,\" Szili explained to Medscape Medical News.\nThe formulation's synergistic effect \"can be used to target a broad spectrum of microbes and infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses,\" he added.\nGas Killed Bacteria in Foot Ulcers, COVID-19 Virus\nFor the study, the authors tested the strategy in lab experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responsible for infections in the blood, lungs, and other areas after surgery, and Staphylococcus aureus, linked to potentially life-threatening blood poisoning and pneumonia.\nThey found that, while the use of cold plasma alone was effective against P. aeruginosa, it had minimal effect on S. aureus. However, the combination treatment showed successful eradication of both types of bacteria.\n\"This is very significant for diabetic patients who have foot ulcers that are hard to heal,\" Szili said in the press statement.\nSimilar trends were observed when the virucidal activities of the formulation were tested against SARS-CoV-2.\nThe experiments showed that the plasma-activated blend effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load by 50%-84%, raising the possibility of its use in disinfecting surfaces such in hospitals or air-conditioning systems.",

            "Content": "A new study on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the healthcare leadership structure of organizations in the United States has found that women are underrepresented, despite making up a majority of the overall healthcare workforce. Fifteen percent of health system and health insurer CEOs are women, according to the study, which was published online today in JAMA Network Open. Representation by women as chairpersons of the board of directors at health systems and health insurers was just slightly better: 17.5% of chairpersons at health systems are women, and 21.3% of boards of directors have chairpersons who are women.\nThe study also found that having a woman as a health system CEO was associated with a higher proportion of women on the board of directors or in roles as senior executives. Having more women in senior leadership roles at health insurance companies was also associated with increased representation of women as CEOs, per the study.\nResearchers also learned that more than half (58.1%) of the leadership positions in the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are held by women.\nBismarck Odei, MD, lead author of the study, told Medscape Medical News that he was most surprised that \"the healthcare system in one of the largest populated countries in the world, where women form a slight majority, has so few women leaders influencing the day-to-day healthcare realities of women.\"\nStill, he points to the gender diversity of healthcare organizations' boards of directors as \"not a trivial statistic.\"\n\"It may be one of the more important parameters that can increase the representation of women in the CEO position across healthcare organizations,\" said Odei, a radiation oncology resident at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.\nHealthcare Organizations Are More Diverse Than Fortune 500\nAs a benchmark, women are more likely to serve as CEO at healthcare organizations than at Fortune 500 companies. Fortune reported in June that only 8.1% of these companies are led by women CEOs. Barron's reported in July that 29% of US board directors were women in 2020, which is up from 19% in 2014.\nIn addition, a 2019 analysis by consulting firm McKinsey revealed that organizations in the top quartile in terms of gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to deliver above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile.\nThe JAMA study authors wrote that the underrepresentation of women on leadership teams, especially since women make up slightly more than half (50.8%) of the US population, \"likely diminishes their role in policy decisions that affect population and women's health.\"\nPutting the study in the larger context of research in this area, Odei observes that increased diversity improves organizational performance. \"The US healthcare system has been valiantly trying to reach its full potential for some time now, and strengthening its leadership ranks with diverse and innovative voices will be key to achieving its goals.\"",

            "Content": "An oral, experimental medication that targets the bacteria that causes gum disease may offer a \"new treatment paradigm\" for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), new research suggests.\nDr Michael Detke\nResults from the phase 2/3 GAIN trial of atuzaginstat (Cortexyme Inc), which targets the gum bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), suggest the pathogen is a \"potential driver of AD.\"\n\"We showed the efficacy and safety of our drug in patients with mild to moderate AD who have Pg infection; and we think we found an optimal dose. This represents a whole new treatment paradigm for AD,\" study investigator Michael J. Detke, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at Cortexyme, told Medscape Medical News.\nThe findings were presented at the 14th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) Conference.\nLow-Grade Chronic Infection\nPg is associated with gum disease, including gingivitis and periodontal disease. Detke added that periodontal disease affects about 65 million Americans.\nPrevious research has linked periodontal disease with an increased risk for AD. One study cited by Detke showed individuals with a severe form of the gum disease declined by six points on the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) in 6 months vs only one point among those with mild or no periodontal disease.\nEvidence linking inflammation with AD is \"consistent with the idea there's...a low-grade chronic infection that's causing this inflammatory response,\" Detke said.\nHe noted that 22 of the last 25 genetic risk factors identified for AD relate to immune system function.\nPg is different from other bacteria in that it gets inside cells and relies on proteins as an energy source instead of sugars or carbohydrates. The bacteria release proteases called gingipains that \"chop up\" proteins into fragments that provide the energy, said Detke.\nAtuzaginstat is designed to stop damage caused by gingipain protease by cutting off the bacteria's food supply. Because Pg is inside cells and \"can go dormant or develop resistance,\" it is extremely difficult to completely wipe it out with typical antibiotics, Detke noted.\nSlowed Cognitive Decline\nThe GAIN trial included 643 generally healthy patients aged 55 to 80 years (mean age, 69 years) with mild to moderate AD, as measured by a score of 12 to 24 on the mini-mental state exam. About 65% were ApoE4 carriers.\nAll participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or a low dose (40 mg twice a day) or high dose (80 mg twice a day) of atuzaginstat for 48 weeks.\nIn addition to standard cognitive outcomes, researchers assessed biomarkers of Pg in saliva, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",

The review \"identified all of the published literature related to the relationship between diet and psychiatric symptoms of SSD,\" synthesizing the results of 822 prior articles.\nIt promotes the addition of nutritious food rather than restricting calories or individual foods and does not contradict generally accepted recommendations for weight management. It is suitable for all patients including those with low or normal body mass index and provides psychoeducation about the importance of quality nutrition as a determinant of mental health.\nPositive Tone\nThe worksheet was informed by Social Cognitive Theory, which \"highlights the important role of goal setting and behavior contracting, reinforcement, self-control, social norms, attitudes, and self-efficacy.\"\nIt provides \"basic education about important nutrition principles\" as well as \"very simple recommendations to increase knowledge about healthy eating\" and \"actional tips for individuals to incorporate.\" The researchers used a \"positive\" tone and included motivational interviewing questions.\n\"Delivery of the intervention by the patient's mental health care provider is by design, in an attempt to address the widely held misbelief that nutrition intervention is of limited importance to mental health care and begin to change norms,\" LaChance said.",

A unique aspect of the study design was that randomization was weighted toward the most effective dose.\n\"It was the first time this design was used for AD and it was successful in identifying the highest dose as most likely to be effective. Fewer and fewer patients were randomized to lower doses by this algorithm,\" said Irizarry.\nThe results presented were for those receiving the 10 mg/kg biweekly dose vs placebo.\nOne of the endpoints was the AD Composite Score (ADCOMS). Developed by Eisai, ADCOMS is a composite of elements from several established scales for AD that are \"most sensitive to progression early in AD,\" said Irizarry.\nThe results indicated a 30% difference in ADCOMS scores among the 79 subjects receiving the drug vs the 160 taking a placebo (P < .05) at 18 months.\nThere were similar results for the secondary endpoints of Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog). Secondary endpoints also included amyloid PET and fluid biomarkers.\nFor amyloid PET, results showed 81% of patients converted from amyloid positive to amyloid negative by visual readout for the treated vs placebo groups (P < .0001) at 18 months.\nThe study showed a significant change in plasma A\u03b242/40 ratio (P < .01) \"in a way that would be expected with amyloid clearance,\" said Irizarry.\nResults also showed that amyloid reduction as shown both on PET and through the plasma A\u03b242/40 ratio corelated with positive clinical outcomes.\nThe benefits of lecanemab on imaging, plasma biomarkers, and clinical outcomes were maintained during a \"gap\" period following the core study where patients did not receive the drug for an average of 2 years before the open-label extension (OLE) phase.",

Inspectors with the Department of Building and Safety will enforce the mandate, and the city hopes to eventually get assistance from the LA County Department of Public Health, Tso said. She didn't immediately know if any warnings or citations were issued on Monday.\nLos Angeles is among a growing number of cities across the U.S., including San Francisco and New York City, requiring people show proof of vaccination to enter various types of businesses and venues. But rules in the nation's second-most-populous city, called SafePassLA, apply to more types of businesses and other indoor locations including concert halls, museums and convention centers.\nA sign reminding customers to be prepared to show their vaccine cards hangs at the Muddy Paw Coffee Shop in the Eagle Rock neighborhood, where owner Darren Laborie said he's thankful that the vast majority of his regulars have happily complied with the shifting regulations over the past year and a half.\n\"We have to adapt to whatever rules are coming at us. And our customers go along with us,\" Laborie said. Those that don't want to wear a mask or show vaccine proof can sit in the outdoor patio or take their coffees and pastries to go, he said.\nOne year ago, Los Angeles was becoming the state's epicenter of the worst spike of the pandemic in California. By January an average of 500 people were dying statewide every day.\nTo guard against another spike in cases, deaths and hospitalizations, the LA City Council voted 11-2 last month for the ordinance that requires people 12 and older to be fully vaccinated to enter indoor public spaces including sports arenas, museums, spas, indoor city facilities and other locations. Retail stores and shopping malls are exempt.\nNegative coronavirus tests within 72 hours of entry to those establishments would be required for people with religious or medical exemptions for vaccinations. Customers without proof can still use outdoor facilities and can briefly enter a business to use a restroom or pick up a food order.",

Szili said in a press statement on the research, published in Applied Physics Letters.\n\"We investigated whether this same technology could be effective at killing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it appears that it is,\" said Szili, a senior research fellow and head of the Plasma Medicine Research Group at the Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Adelaide.\n\"To the best of knowledge our study is the first report on the use of plasma in combination with acetyl donor molecules,\" the authors note.\nCold plasma is a low-temperature, electrically generated, partially ionized glow-discharge that is tolerable to human tissue. Although the plasma gas can kill bacteria, the treatment can lose effectiveness against notoriously resistant biofilms.\nTo try to improve its efficacy in killing bacteria, Szili and colleagues combined the cold plasma with acetyl donor molecules and found the combination generated hydrogen peroxide and released peracetic acid, enhancing the ability to destroy resistant bacteria through a multipronged action.\n\"The combination of the cold plasma with acetyl donors produces additional oxidants that are less affected by the bacteria's antioxidant defense mechanisms,\" Szili explained to Medscape Medical News.\nThe formulation's synergistic effect \"can be used to target a broad spectrum of microbes and infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses,\" he added.\nGas Killed Bacteria in Foot Ulcers, COVID-19 Virus\nFor the study, the authors tested the strategy in lab experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responsible for infections in the blood, lungs, and other areas after surgery, and Staphylococcus aureus, linked to potentially life-threatening blood poisoning and pneumonia.\nThey found that, while the use of cold plasma alone was effective against P. aeruginosa, it had minimal effect on S. aureus. However, the combination treatment showed successful eradication of both types of bacteria.\n\"This is very significant for diabetic patients who have foot ulcers that are hard to heal,\" Szili said in the press statement.\nSimilar trends were observed when the virucidal activities of the formulation were tested against SARS-CoV-2.\nThe experiments showed that the plasma-activated blend effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load by 50%-84%, raising the possibility of its use in disinfecting surfaces such in hospitals or air-conditioning systems.",

Inspectors with the Department of Building and Safety will enforce the mandate, and the city hopes to eventually get assistance from the LA County Department of Public Health, Tso said. She didn't immediately know if any warnings or citations were issued on Monday.\nLos Angeles is among a growing number of cities across the U.S., including San Francisco and New York City, requiring people show proof of vaccination to enter various types of businesses and venues. But rules in the nation's second-most-populous city, called SafePassLA, apply to more types of businesses and other indoor locations including concert halls, museums and convention centers.\nA sign reminding customers to be prepared to show their vaccine cards hangs at the Muddy Paw Coffee Shop in the Eagle Rock neighborhood, where owner Darren Laborie said he's thankful that the vast majority of his regulars have happily complied with the shifting regulations over the past year and a half.\n\"We have to adapt to whatever rules are coming at us. And our customers go along with us,\" Laborie said. Those that don't want to wear a mask or show vaccine proof can sit in the outdoor patio or take their coffees and pastries to go, he said.\nOne year ago, Los Angeles was becoming the state's epicenter of the worst spike of the pandemic in California. By January an average of 500 people were dying statewide every day.\nTo guard against another spike in cases, deaths and hospitalizations, the LA City Council voted 11-2 last month for the ordinance that requires people 12 and older to be fully vaccinated to enter indoor public spaces including sports arenas, museums, spas, indoor city facilities and other locations. Retail stores and shopping malls are exempt.\nNegative coronavirus tests within 72 hours of entry to those establishments would be required for people with religious or medical exemptions for vaccinations. Customers without proof can still use outdoor facilities and can briefly enter a business to use a restroom or pick up a food order.",

The country's minister of health announced last week that the variant had already spread in different areas of the country. \nThe next day, the World Health Organization designated Omicron a \"variant of concern.\" \nPresident Joe Biden echoed this statement at a news briefing today, but he stressed that the new variant is a \"cause for concern, not a cause for panic.\"\nCOVID-19 vaccine makers are looking into the vaccine's protection against the new variant.\n\"The mutations in the Omicron variant are concerning, and for several days, we have been moving as fast as possible to execute our strategy to address this variant,\" St\u00e9phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, said in a statement. \nPfizer says that data about its vaccine's protection against Omicron should be released in the coming weeks. \nA number of countries are making efforts to prevent the global spread of Omicron. The US is just one of a number of countries that have placed new travel restrictions on South Africa and its neighboring countries. \nSo what makes Omicron different from other COVID-19 variants? And how concerned should we be? Health experts help us break it down. \nWhat Do We Know So Far? \nThere is a lot that we don't know about Omicron, including whether it causes more severe illness than other variants, says Leana Wen, MD, MSc, an emergency doctor and public health professor at George Washington University in Washington, DC.\nBut we do know that it's a variant with an unusually high number of mutations, or changes in the virus' genetic material. \nEarly evidence also shows that the Omicron variant may spread easier than other COVID-19 variants, she says. \n\"That's very concerning because Delta, which is the dominant variant here in the US and around the world, is already extremely contagious. So, if this is even more contagious, it could displace the Delta variant,\" says Wen.\nIs the Omicron Variant in the US?\nAs of right now, no cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in the US. \nEither way, you should stay calm, says William Schaffner, MD, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\"Even if it were to be here in the United States, the dominant \u2014 the 99% that is causing disease in your community today \u2014 that strain is Delta,\" he says. \"And we know the vaccines work against Delta.\"\nWill COVID-19 Vaccines Work Against Omicron?\n\"We don't know whether the large number of mutations renders the vaccines less effective against this variant,\" says Wen. \"Although many scientists believe \u2014 especially with a booster shot \u2014 that it's not going to render the vaccines ineffective.\"",

But the new findings offer \"a glimpse of hope\" that these patients may get some protection from the mRNA vaccines after all, the study's leader said.\nThe researchers studied mRNA vaccine responses in 37 patients taking these drugs for rheumatic diseases or multiple sclerosis, comparing them to 22 individuals with healthy immune systems. Only about 70% of the patients developed antibodies in response to the mRNA vaccines, and their levels were significantly lower than levels in the healthy volunteers.\nHowever, both groups had equal levels of T cells that could recognize and attack the coronavirus.\n\"Our study suggests that patients on anti-CD20 treatment are able to mount potent T-cell responses to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines,\" despite impaired antibody responses, the researchers wrote.\nThe size of the study \"does not allow us to draw firm conclusions about protection from severe COVID-19 in these patients,\" said Dr. Christiane Eberhardt of the University of Geneva in Switzerland.

            "Content": "Short-acting opioids may complement methadone and buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal symptoms in U.S. hospitals, say authors of an opinion piece calling for rethinking current strategies for opioid withdrawal in this country.\nThe commentary by Robert A. Kleinman, MD, with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and department of psychiatry, University of Toronto, and Sarah E. Wakeman, MD, with the division of general internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, was published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\nCurrently, short-acting opioids are not recommended in the United States for opioid withdrawal symptoms (OWS) management in the hospital, the authors wrote. Instead, withdrawal symptoms are typically treated, followed by methadone or buprenorphine or nonopioid medications, but many patients don't get enough relief. Undertreated withdrawal can result in patients leaving the hospital against medical advice, which is linked with higher risk of death.\nAddiction specialist Elisabeth Poorman, MD, of the University of Illinois Chicago, said in an interview that she agrees it's time to start shifting the thinking on using short-acting opioids for OWS in hospitals. Use varies greatly by hospital and by clinician, she said.\n\"It's time to let evidence guide us and to be flexible,\" Poorman said.\nThe commentary authors noted that with methadone, patients must wait several hours for maximal symptom reduction, and the full benefits of methadone treatment are not realized until days after initiation.\nRapid initiation of methadone may be feasible in hospitals and has been proposed as an option, but further study is necessary before widespread use, the authors wrote.\nShort-Acting Opioids May Address Limitations of Other Opioids\nLofexidine, an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically for OWS.\n\"However,\" the authors said, \"more than half of patients with OWS treated with lofexidine in phase 3 efficacy trials dropped out by day five. Clonidine, another alpha-2-agonist used off label to treat OWS, has similar effects to those of lofexidine. \"\nTherefore, short-acting opioids may complement methadone and buprenorphine in treating OWS in the hospital by addressing their limitations, the authors wrote.\nKleinman and Wakeman also say short-acting opioids may help with starting buprenorphine for patients exposed to fentanyl, because short-acting opioids can relieve withdrawal symptoms while fentanyl is metabolized and excreted.\nSupplementation with short-acting opioids within the hospital can relieve withdrawal symptoms and help keep patients comfortable while methadone is titrated to more effective doses for long-term treatment, they wrote.\nWith short-acting opioids, patients may become more engaged in their care with, for example, a tamper-proof, patient-controlled analgesia pump, which would allow them to have more autonomy in administration of opioids to relieve pain and withdrawal symptoms, the authors wrote.",

There have been several clinical trials of the treatment in knee osteoarthritis, but the current study's authors said these were limited by factors such as a lack of blinding and were at high risk of bias. \"That was the impetus to do a large, high-quality study and to look at joint structure,\" Bennell said.\nStudy Details\nFor the study, which was published November 23 in JAMA, the researchers enrolled 288 adults older than 50 with knee osteoarthritis who had experienced knee pain on most days of the past month and had radiographic evidence of mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the tibiofemoral joint.\nAfter having stopped all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and pain-relief drugs 2 weeks prior \u2015 except acetaminophen \u2015 participants were randomly assigned to receive three weekly intra-articular knee injections of either a commercially available leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma or saline placebo. They were then followed for 12 months.\nAmong the 288 participants in the study, researchers saw no statistically significant difference in the change in pain scores between the treatment and placebo groups at 12 months, although there was a nonsignificantly greater reduction in pain scores among those given platelet-rich plasma. The study also found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the change in medial tibial cartilage volume.\nThe researchers also looked at a large number of secondary outcomes, including the effects of treatment on pain and function at 2 months, change in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) scores, and change in quality-of-life scores. There were no indications of any benefits from the treatment at the 2-month follow-up, and at 12 months, the study showed no significant improvements in knee pain while walking or in pain scores, KOOS scores, or quality-of-life measures.\nHowever, significantly more participants in the treatment group than in the placebo group reported overall improvement at the 2-month point \u2015 48.2% of those in the treatment arm compared with 36.2% of the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05 \u2013 1.80; P = .02). At 12 months, 42.8% of those who received platelet-rich plasma reported improved function, compared with 32.1% of those in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00 \u2013 1.86, P = .05).",

Barron's reported in July that 29% of US board directors were women in 2020, which is up from 19% in 2014.\nIn addition, a 2019 analysis by consulting firm McKinsey revealed that organizations in the top quartile in terms of gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to deliver above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile.\nThe JAMA study authors wrote that the underrepresentation of women on leadership teams, especially since women make up slightly more than half (50.8%) of the US population, \"likely diminishes their role in policy decisions that affect population and women's health.\"\nPutting the study in the larger context of research in this area, Odei observes that increased diversity improves organizational performance. \"The US healthcare system has been valiantly trying to reach its full potential for some time now, and strengthening its leadership ranks with diverse and innovative voices will be key to achieving its goals.\"",

            "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A risk score based on readily available variables from patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) accurately predicted the risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) in a modeling study.\n\"CA-AKI is an important complication and is associated with long-term mortality, mostly driven by mortality in the first 30 days after PCI,\" Dr. Roxana Mehran of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City told Reuters Health by email.\n\"We developed a very user friendly and highly embraced, well validated risk score (Mehran CIN risk score) back in 2004,\" she said. \"We knew for sure that a risk score that is almost 20 years old would need a re-calibration but took the opportunity to see if there are new risk factors that can be assessed before, as well as during, the procedure.\"\n\"I was thrilled to see that the rates of AKI after contrast media injection/PCI have decreased despite higher-risk patients with increasing PCI complexity,\" she said. \"We observed different rates depending on which definition was used for AKI, and endorse the standardization of definitions to identify those at risk who would also be at higher risk for late mortality.\"\n\"We also identified new parameters, like hyperglycemia, as an important predictor in the risk score,\" she added.\nFor the update, published in The Lancet, 14,616 patients who underwent PCI between 2012-2017 were included in the derivation cohort (mean age, 66.2; 29.2% women) and 5,606 treated from 2018-2020 were included in the validation cohort (mean age. 67; 26.4% women).\nThe primary endpoint -- CA-AKI, defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network -- occurred in 860 (4.3%) patients overall.\nModel 1 included only pre-procedural variables: clinical presentation, estimated glomerular filtration rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes, hemoglobin, basal glucose, congestive heart failure, and age.\nModel 2 also included procedural variables: contrast volume, peri-procedural bleeding, no flow or slow flow post-procedure, and complex PCI anatomy.\nCA-AKI occurrence in the derivation cohort increased gradually from the lowest to the highest of the four risk score groups in both models (2.3%-34.9% in model 1; 2.0%-38.8% in model 2).\nInclusion of procedural variables only slightly improved discrimination of the risk score (C-statistic in the derivation cohort, 0.72 for model 1 and 0.74 for model 2; in the validation cohort, 0.84 for model 1 and 0.86 for model 2).\nThe risk of death at one-year follow-up increased significantly in patients with CA-AKI (10.2% vs. 2.5%; adjusted hazard ratio 1.76), mainly due, as Dr. Mehran indicated, to excess 30-day deaths.\nThe authors state, \"Our study confirms the increased risk of (CA-AKI) in high-risk subgroups of patients, such as older people and those with congestive heart failure or impaired renal function, underlining the need for tailored preventive strategies in these patients, as well as allowing (CA-AKI) prevention measures to be abbreviated in patients at low risk.\"\nDr. Mehran said, \"We feel that the score should await external validation, despite an excellent C-statistic for the internal validation process. We are working with our colleagues to externally validate this score, and applaud those who are already working on this.\"\nDrs. Estelle Nijssen and Joachim Wildberger of Maastricht University Medial Centre in the Netherlands, coauthors of a related editorial, commented in an email to Reuters Health, \"What is intriguing is that the risk score appears to highlight the importance of the heart for risk assessment in the setting of contrast procedures, where the focus previously lay on the kidneys and contrast material. This is a major paradigm shift.\"\n\"However, it may be important for clinicians to realize that there are no firm data to either confirm or reject a causal link between contrast administration and kidney injury or adverse events,\" they said. \"Nor is there firm evidence that prophylactic strategies improve outcomes in the long term.\"\n\"On a practical level, implementation in daily clinical practice could be complicated because it might not always be clear what to do with a patient who has a high score,\" they noted. \"Extra vigilance can of course always be applied, but prophylactic strategies (mainly intravenous hydration before and/or after contrast administration) carry risk, which is especially relevant for high-score cardiac patients.\"\nSOURCE: https://bit.ly/3I6RQQO and https://bit.ly/3cOUpII The Lancet, online November 15, 2021.",

            "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new study adds to growing evidence that use of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) is associated with an increased risk of certain retinal disorders, researchers say.\nPPS is commonly prescribed to relieve bladder pain and discomfort due to interstitial cystitis.\n\"This study was an attempt to replicate the results of existing studies which, admittedly, have been very consistent.\" Dr. Gerald McGwin of the University of Alabama at Birmingham told Reuters Health by email. \"Despite the consistency of the research to date, there remain some unresolved epidemiologic issues, including the relevant dose and duration of exposure, the impact on visual function and whether any visual changes are reversible with cessation of the medication.\"\n\"Also, the FAERS (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System) is a unique resource which has only rarely been used in ophthalmology, so we also viewed the study as an opportunity to highlight FAERS,\" he noted.\n\"The current drug label warns users about the potential visual side effects,\" he said. \"However, it would be advisable for clinicians to highlight this side effect to their patients, specifically of the early signs of the potentially irreversible retinal damage/injury.\"\n\"As with many epidemiologic studies, the focus is often on the RELATIVE risk of an outcome or side effect,\" he added. \"In this case, while the relative risk is high, the ABSOLUTE risk is quite low. Therefore, the well-established beneficial effects of this drug should be weighed against the rarity of this specific side effect.\"\nAs reported in JAMA Ophthalmology, Dr. McGwin and colleagues conducted a disproportionality analysis using the FAERS from 2013-2020, comparing adverse event reports associated with various drugs taken for interstitial cystitis, cystitis, bladder disorder, or bladder pain.\nThe main outcome was retinal adverse events, including conditions associated with retinal damage attributable to blockage of its blood supply, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, and diseases affecting the retina.\nA total of 2,775 reports were included in the PPS group (70.9% for women) and 6,833 in the other drugs group (59.1% for women).\nThe proportion of adverse events for any macular event relative to all other events was higher for PPS users compared with those using other interstitial cystitis and bladder pain drugs (proportionate reporting ratio, 1.21).\nSpecific retinal conditions that were proportionately more common among PPS users included: macular degeneration (0.8% of users vs. 0.2%); maculopathy (3.4%] vs. 0.03%); retinal dystrophy (0.1% vs. 0), retinal injury (0.2% vs. 0), and retinal toxicity (0.1% vs. 0).\nSumming up, the authors state, \"The results of the current study add to the growing evidence that PPS use is associated with an increased risk of maculopathy. Studies that rule out prevalent retinal abnormalities prior to the initiation of PPS would strengthen the current body of literature.\"\nDr. Nimesh Patel, an ophthalmologist in the Retina Service at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston commented in an email to Reuters Health, \"I am in agreement with the findings. I have found retinal damage associated with PPS use in patients that were previously suspected to have age-related macular degeneration.\"\n\"All patients taking the medication should be made aware of the possible and not infrequent retinal damage that is caused by this medication,\" he said. \"It would be reasonable to consider a referral to an eye doctor to look for signs of toxicity if there are any visual concerns.\"\n\"This is a relatively new discovery and ongoing study is required to assess the long-term effects of the medication,\" he added. \"It is unclear if the retinal damage can progress despite the cessation of the offending agent.\"\nSOURCE: https://bit.ly/2Zr0MPk JAMA Ophthalmology, online November 18, 2021.",

She also jumped on the cookie-cutter thread.\n\"It just kind of resonated with me,\" Merrill said of the liver-and-pancreas cookie cutter. She was impressed by the accuracy of the rendition: \"I mean, it doesn't have the blood vessels and it only had one pancreatic duct there; you know, there are usually two at least. So it's not 100% accurate. But it was pretty accurate. I felt like the bile ducts were pretty good.\"\nBakerlogy owner Louise Alan said they've been doing medical designs since 2015. They are trickier than the company's other products. \"Too much detail will make the design look too cluttered and yet it needs just enough detail for an accurate depiction,\" Alan said, adding that the anatomical heart was particularly popular.\n Merrill was impressed by the range of organs available but wasn't sure she'd like to chow down on some of the creations: \"There were a lot there I definitely wouldn't want to eat\u2026like sperm cookies.\"\n However, Merrill said, \"It's nice to bring some joy and a little bit of levity to what we do and the cookie cutters do that, and allow us to\u2026joke around a little bit since we're mostly dealing with very serious and emotional things.\"\nMckay agreed.

Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), a co-sponsor of the Momnibus. The bill has passed Congress and awaits President Biden's signature.\nRep. Lauren Underwood (D-IL) along with Rep. Alma Adams (D- NC-12), Sen. Cory Booker D-NJ), and members of the Black Maternal Health Caucus reintroduced the bill (first introduced last year). According to Rep. Underwood, the act would codify and strengthen the VA maternity care coordination programs. It also will require the US Government Accountability Office to report the deaths of pregnant and postpartum veterans and to focus on any racial or ethnic disparities. The bill passed overwhelmingly, 414 to 9, and awaits President Biden's signature.\nThe Momnibus's cute name represents a very serious purpose. \"Maternal mortality has historically been used as a key indicator of the health of a population,\" say researchers from National Vital Statistics Reports. But American mothers are dying at the highest rate in the developed world, and the numbers have been rising dramatically. Between 1987, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System in 2017, the latest year for available data, the number of reported pregnancy-related deaths in the United States rose steadily from 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births to 17.3 per 100,000.\nThe maternal morbidity crisis is particularly stark among certain groups of women. Black women are acutely at risk, dying at 3 to 4 times the rate of White women (41.7 deaths per 100,000 live births), and one-third higher than the next highest risk group, Native American women (28.3 deaths per 100,000 live births).\nBut just how accurate have the data been? The study published in National Vital Statistics Report found that using a checkbox for \"cause of death\" specifying maternal death identified more than triple the number of maternal deaths. Without the checkbox item, maternal mortality rates in 2015 and 2016 would have been reported as 8.7 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with 8.9 in 2002. With the checkbox, the rate would be reported as 20.9 per 100,000 live births in 2015 and 21.8/100,000 in 2016.\nThe CDC states that the reasons for the rising numbers are unclear; advances in identification have improved over time, for one. But by and large, the women are dying of preventable causes, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic heart disease. Nearly 60% of maternal deaths are deemed preventable.\nBlack and other minority women, though, may be dying of biases. Researchers from Beth Israel and Harvard cite studies that have found racial and ethnic disparities in obstetric care delivery. Non-Hispanic Blacks women, Hispanic women, and Asian women, for instance, have lower odds of labor induction when compared with that of White women. The odds of receiving an episiotomy are lower in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women. The Listening to Mothers survey III found that 24% of participants perceived discrimination during birth hospitalization, predominantly among Black or Hispanic women and uninsured women.",

Japan on Monday joined Israel in saying it would close its borders completely to foreigners.\nThe WHO reiterated that, pending further advice, countries should use a \"risk-based approach to adjust international travel measures\", while acknowledging that a rise in coronavirus cases might lead to higher morbidity and mortality rates.\n\"The impact on vulnerable populations would be substantial, particularly in countries with low vaccination coverage,\" it added.\nIn vaccinated persons, meanwhile, \"COVID-19 cases and infections are expected ... albeit in a small and predictable proportion\".\nOverall, there were \"considerable uncertainties in the magnitude of immune escape potential of Omicron\", and more data was expected in coming weeks.",

Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said the state won't be \"defenseless\" if everyone wears masks indoors, gets vaccinated, gets tested, washes their hands and stays home when sick.\n\"Mark my words, we're going to see a surge in the next five days,\" Hochul said.\nAnd Dr. Dave Chokshi, the commissioner, said he is \"strongly recommending\" that all New Yorkers wear masks \"at all times when indoors and in a public setting like at your grocery or in a building lobby, offices and retail stores.\"\nThe guidance was in line with the recommendation issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in July that even vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where the virus is surging.\nMuch is still not known about the omicron variant, which was identified last week by researchers in South Africa, including whether it is more contagious than other coronavirus variants, or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.\nCases of the omicron variant have been found in countries including Canada, Australia and the Netherlands, but no cases have yet been detected in the United States.\nMayor Bill de Blasio said that while there have been no cases of the omicron variant reported in New York City, \"it is very likely there will be.\"\nChokshi, who joined de Blasio at a virtual news briefing, said the delta variant of the virus accounts for 98% of the coronavirus samples from New York City that are being sequenced now.\nHochul said she wasn't ready to announce any new sweeping COVID-19 protocols, like restrictions on visits at nursing homes.\nShe said she supports recent announcements by Erie County officials, who have warned that the county could start requiring vaccine mandates for indoor dining if rates keep surging.\nVaccination rates are increasing overall in New York, fueled in part by a mandate for health care workers to get vaccinated. New York City has also required vaccinations for city workers and for indoor dining, for example.\nBut vaccination rates are lower in western New York, the Finger Lakes and other rural communities north of New York City and its surrounding suburbs: as low as 40% in Allegany County, 47% in Wyoming County, and 49% in Yates and Seneca counties.",

It's one word that carries these two huge stories,\" he said.\nLookups for the word increased 601% from 2020, Merriam-Webster said in a news release, and went up 1048% from 2019 to 2021. Political conflict, not just a need for information, drove interest in the word.\n\"The promising medical solution to the pandemic that upended our lives in 2020 also became a political argument and source of division,\" Merriam-Webster said. \"The biggest science story of our time quickly became the biggest debate in our country, and the word at the center of both stories is vaccine.\"\n\"Pandemic\" had the most lookups last year and \"was the gun going off and now we have the aftereffects,\" Sokolowski said.\nInterest in \"vaccine\" was so high that Merriam-Webster expanded the definition to include new terminology related to the pandemic, such as messenger RNA.\nThe Associated Press said Merriam-Webster has been naming a word of the year since 2008 and bases its selection on lookup numbers after weeding out evergreens.\nOther top words for 2021 were insurrection, infrastructure, perseverance (the name of NASA's Mars rover), and nomad (for the movie \"Nomadland.\")\nSources\nThe Associated Press. \"Merriam-Webster chooses vaccine as the 2021 word of the year\"\nMerriam-Webster. \"Word of the Year: Vaccine\"",

            "Content": "(Reuters) - Existing COVID-19 vaccines should be highly effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalisation from the newly identified Omicron variant, a top South African infectious disease expert said on Monday.\nProfessor Salim Abdool Karim, who served as the government's chief adviser during the initial response to the pandemic, also said it was too early to say whether Omicron led to more severe clinical symptoms than previous variants.\nHowever, he said it did appear more contagious and more likely to infect people with immunity from vaccination or prior infection, and he was expecting it to drive new daily infections in the country above 10,000 before the end of the week, from 2,858 on Sunday.\n\"Based on what we know and how the other variants of concern have reacted to vaccine immunity, we can expect that we will still see high effectiveness for hospitalisation and severe disease, and that protection of the vaccines is likely to remain strong,\" Abdool Karim told a news conference.\nPreventing severe disease is mainly a function of T-cell immunity, different from the antibody immunity that often blocks infections, \"so even if there's some escape from antibodies it's very hard to escape T-cell immunity\", he said.\nThe discovery of the variant in southern Africa has caused a strong global reaction, with countries limiting travel from the region and imposing other restrictions for fear it could spread quickly even in vaccinated populations.\nThe World Health Organization said on Monday that the variant posed a very high global risk of infection surges, though further research was needed to assess its potential to evade protection against immunity induced by vaccines and previous infections.\nSouth African doctors who have treated COVID-19 patients say Omicron so far appears to be producing mild symptoms, including a dry cough, fever and night sweats.\nAbdool Karim, a professor at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal and Columbia University in the United States, said no \"red flags\" had been raised so far.\nHowever, it was too early to draw firm conclusions, because doctors can only comment on patients who they treat. \"There's not enough data yet,\" he said.\nSouth Africa's government is doing everything possible to prepare its health facilities to cope with the variant and is asking countries that imposed travel restrictions on southern Africa to reverse them, Health Minister Joe Phaahla told the same news conference.\nPublic health officials said Gauteng province, where cases have surged since the variant's discovery, had so far not seen an increase in COVID-19 deaths. It was not yet possible to say whether Omicron has caused any fatalities, they added.",

            "Content": "It's called the Momnibus \u2014 the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 (HR 959) with 12 bills addressing \"every dimension of the maternal health crisis in America.\" The first bill in the Momnibus to pass Congress is the Protecting Moms Who Served act, which sets up a $15 million maternal care program within the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \"There has never been a comprehensive evaluation of how our nation's growing maternal mortality crisis is impacting our women veterans, even though they may be at higher risk due to their service,\" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), a co-sponsor of the Momnibus. The bill has passed Congress and awaits President Biden's signature.\nRep. Lauren Underwood (D-IL) along with Rep. Alma Adams (D- NC-12), Sen. Cory Booker D-NJ), and members of the Black Maternal Health Caucus reintroduced the bill (first introduced last year). According to Rep. Underwood, the act would codify and strengthen the VA maternity care coordination programs. It also will require the US Government Accountability Office to report the deaths of pregnant and postpartum veterans and to focus on any racial or ethnic disparities. The bill passed overwhelmingly, 414 to 9, and awaits President Biden's signature.\nThe Momnibus's cute name represents a very serious purpose. \"Maternal mortality has historically been used as a key indicator of the health of a population,\" say researchers from National Vital Statistics Reports. But American mothers are dying at the highest rate in the developed world, and the numbers have been rising dramatically. Between 1987, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System in 2017, the latest year for available data, the number of reported pregnancy-related deaths in the United States rose steadily from 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births to 17.3 per 100,000.\nThe maternal morbidity crisis is particularly stark among certain groups of women. Black women are acutely at risk, dying at 3 to 4 times the rate of White women (41.7 deaths per 100,000 live births), and one-third higher than the next highest risk group, Native American women (28.3 deaths per 100,000 live births).\nBut just how accurate have the data been? The study published in National Vital Statistics Report found that using a checkbox for \"cause of death\" specifying maternal death identified more than triple the number of maternal deaths. Without the checkbox item, maternal mortality rates in 2015 and 2016 would have been reported as 8.7 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with 8.9 in 2002. With the checkbox, the rate would be reported as 20.9 per 100,000 live births in 2015 and 21.8/100,000 in 2016.\nThe CDC states that the reasons for the rising numbers are unclear; advances in identification have improved over time, for one. But by and large, the women are dying of preventable causes, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic heart disease. Nearly 60% of maternal deaths are deemed preventable.\nBlack and other minority women, though, may be dying of biases. Researchers from Beth Israel and Harvard cite studies that have found racial and ethnic disparities in obstetric care delivery. Non-Hispanic Blacks women, Hispanic women, and Asian women, for instance, have lower odds of labor induction when compared with that of White women. The odds of receiving an episiotomy are lower in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women. The Listening to Mothers survey III found that 24% of participants perceived discrimination during birth hospitalization, predominantly among Black or Hispanic women and uninsured women.",

Inspectors with the Department of Building and Safety will enforce the mandate, and the city hopes to eventually get assistance from the LA County Department of Public Health, Tso said. She didn't immediately know if any warnings or citations were issued on Monday.\nLos Angeles is among a growing number of cities across the U.S., including San Francisco and New York City, requiring people show proof of vaccination to enter various types of businesses and venues. But rules in the nation's second-most-populous city, called SafePassLA, apply to more types of businesses and other indoor locations including concert halls, museums and convention centers.\nA sign reminding customers to be prepared to show their vaccine cards hangs at the Muddy Paw Coffee Shop in the Eagle Rock neighborhood, where owner Darren Laborie said he's thankful that the vast majority of his regulars have happily complied with the shifting regulations over the past year and a half.\n\"We have to adapt to whatever rules are coming at us. And our customers go along with us,\" Laborie said. Those that don't want to wear a mask or show vaccine proof can sit in the outdoor patio or take their coffees and pastries to go, he said.\nOne year ago, Los Angeles was becoming the state's epicenter of the worst spike of the pandemic in California. By January an average of 500 people were dying statewide every day.\nTo guard against another spike in cases, deaths and hospitalizations, the LA City Council voted 11-2 last month for the ordinance that requires people 12 and older to be fully vaccinated to enter indoor public spaces including sports arenas, museums, spas, indoor city facilities and other locations. Retail stores and shopping malls are exempt.\nNegative coronavirus tests within 72 hours of entry to those establishments would be required for people with religious or medical exemptions for vaccinations. Customers without proof can still use outdoor facilities and can briefly enter a business to use a restroom or pick up a food order.",

The complaint was coordinated by the union Global Nurses United and Progressive International, launched last year to unite, organize, and mobilize progressive forces worldwide.\nZenei Triunfo-Cortez, RN\n\"This is tearing me up. No one is safe until everyone is safe,\" Zenei Triunfo-Cortez, RN, co-president of NNU, told Medscape Medical News. The nurses' complaint alleges that the European Union (EU) along with the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, and Singapore are preventing vaccines from getting into the arms of citizens in those countries and are favoring pharmaceutical company profits over human life.\nThe EU and offending countries, according to the complaint, have blocked a temporary waiver of corporate pharmaceutical intellectual property rights under the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the complaint states. The South African and Indian governments proposed the waiver at the WTO last year to speed up the manufacture and distribution of COVID vaccines to low- and moderate-income countries, according to the complaint. More than 45% of the world's population still has not received even one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the complaint alleges.\n\"These countries have violated our rights and the rights of our patients \u2015 and caused the loss of countless lives [through] continued opposition to the TRIPS waiver...resulting in the violation of human rights of peoples across the world,\" according to an NNU press release.\n\"COVID-19 cases continue to soar in numerous parts of the world, while pharmaceutical companies and governments have failed to ensure that critical treatments and vaccines are distributed equitably in order to respond to the pandemic,\" the nurses' unions wrote. \"High-income countries have procured upwards of 7 billion confirmed vaccine doses, while low-income countries have only been able to procure approximately 300 million doses. This has created what public health advocates around the world have described as 'vaccine apartheid.' \"\nCortez said of the lower-income countries, \"We have been sending them vaccines. They should not rely on charity. They should be able to manufacturer their own vaccines.\"\nThe nurses' complaint addressed Tlaleng Mofokeng, MBChB, a physician and the UN's Special Rapporteur on Physical and Mental Health, calling on her to lead an investigation into the nurses' alleged human rights violations. The WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva at which the issue could have been discussed this week was postponed because of the Omicron variant.\n\"We are hoping whenever they reconvene, the committee will act on this under the leadership of Dr Mofokeng,\" Cortez said.\nMofokeng supported the nurses' position, according to the release. \"The nurses' core demand is one I share: States have a collective responsibility to use all available means to facilitate faster access to vaccines, including by introducing a temporary waiver of relevant intellectual property rights under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement),\" she said. \"Nurses and health care workers have been on the front line keeping us safe and have witnessed the most painful and heart-wrenching effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Their evident commitment to the right to physical and mental health provides them with moral authority.\"\nUS President Joe Biden endorsed the waiver in May, but the coordinated campaign by the nurses' unions may be able to convince the UN to take the effort to the next level, Cortez said. \"Hopefully we will create a louder voice and have a much bigger impact\" and persuade the UN committee that it \"should be looking out for the welfare of the world.\"\nFor more news, follow Medscape on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.",

Those who have received booster doses appear to be doing even better.\n\"I would strongly suggest you get boosted now and not wait for the next iteration of [the vaccine], which we may not even need,\" he said. \"The pharmaceutical companies are preparing to make a specific booster for [the Omicron variant], but we may not need that.\"\nAs of Monday morning, 12 countries had reported 165 cases of the Omicron variant to GISAID, a global database for the genomic sequencing of viruses. South Africa, which first detected the variant and reported it to the WHO, has found 114 cases, followed by 19 in Botswana, 12 in the Netherlands, and five in Australia. Four or fewer cases have also been reported in the U.K., Belgium, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, and Italy.\nOn Sunday, Canada became the first country in North America to detect the Omicron variant, with two cases confirmed in Ontario.\nOn Monday, Portugal confirmed 13 cases of the variant among a Lisbon-based soccer club, including one player who had recently traveled to southern Africa, according to ABC News.\nPresident Joe Biden will provide an update on the administration's response to the Omicron variant on Monday, according to The Hill. Biden met with Fauci and members of the White House COVID-19 Response Team on Sunday to discuss the new variant and the latest information from the WHO, which labeled Omicron a \"variant of concern.\"\nDuring the meeting, Fauci told Biden that it will take \"approximately 2 more weeks\" to learn more about the Omicron variant, The Hill reported, including details about how it spreads, how severe it can be, and how well it can evade vaccines.\nFauci emphasized that people should get vaccinated against COVID-19, noting that he believes the shots are \"likely to provide a degree of protection against severe cases of COVID.\" He also urged vaccinated people to get booster shots \"as soon as possible\" to \"provide the strongest available protection from COVID.\"\nA group of senior health officials in the Biden administration had a call with South African scientists on Sunday to review the latest information about the Omicron variant and determine next steps, according to The Washington Post.",

The organization estimates that there will be more than 21,000 new cases and more than 13,000 deaths in 2021.\nCurrently, surgeons use preoperative imaging as well as visual inspection of tumors under normal light and examination by touch to identify ovarian cancer lesions.\nPafolacianine offers a new tool to enhance surgeons' ability \"to identify deadly ovarian tumors that may otherwise go undetected,\" Alex Gorovets, MD, deputy director of the Office of Specialty Medicine in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a press statement.\nOvarian cancer often causes the body to overproduce the folate receptor protein in cell membranes. Pafolacianine, employed with a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system cleared by the FDA for use alongside the drug, binds to and illuminates these proteins under fluorescent light, \"boosting surgeons' ability to identify the cancerous tissue,\" the agency in a statement.\nThe safety and effectiveness of pafolacianine was evaluated in a randomized, multi-center, open-label study of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer or with high clinical suspicion of ovarian cancer. Of the 134 women undergoing surgery who received a dose of pafolacianine and were evaluated under both normal and fluorescent light, 26.9% had at least one cancerous lesion detected that was not observed by standard visual or tactile inspection.\nThe most common side effects of pafolacianine were infusion-related reactions, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, chest discomfort, itching, and hypersensitivity.\nPafolacianine may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The use of folate, folic acid, or folate-containing supplements should be avoided within 48 hours before administration of pafolacianine. \nThe FDA also cautioned about the possible risk of image interpretation errors, including false negatives and false positives, with the use of the new drug and near-infrared fluorescence imaging system.\nThe FDA previously granted pafolacianine orphan-drug, priority, and fast track designations.\nFor more from Medscape Oncology, join us on  Twitter  and  Facebook",
